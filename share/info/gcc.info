1 Programming Languages Supported by GCC
****************************************

GCC stands for "GNU Compiler Collection".  GCC is an integrated
distribution of compilers for several major programming languages.
These languages currently include C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++,
Java, Fortran, and Ada.

 The abbreviation "GCC" has multiple meanings in common use.  The
current official meaning is "GNU Compiler Collection", which refers
generically to the complete suite of tools.  The name historically stood
for "GNU C Compiler", and this usage is still common when the emphasis
is on compiling C programs.  Finally, the name is also used when
speaking of the "language-independent" component of GCC: code shared
among the compilers for all supported languages.

 The language-independent component of GCC includes the majority of the
optimizers, as well as the "back ends" that generate machine code for
various processors.

 The part of a compiler that is specific to a particular language is
called the "front end".  In addition to the front ends that are
integrated components of GCC, there are several other front ends that
are maintained separately.  These support languages such as Pascal,
Mercury, and COBOL.  To use these, they must be built together with GCC
proper.

 Most of the compilers for languages other than C have their own names.
The C++ compiler is G++, the Ada compiler is GNAT, and so on.  When we
talk about compiling one of those languages, we might refer to that
compiler by its own name, or as GCC.  Either is correct.

 Historically, compilers for many languages, including C++ and Fortran,
have been implemented as "preprocessors" which emit another high level
language such as C.  None of the compilers included in GCC are
implemented this way; they all generate machine code directly.  This
sort of preprocessor should not be confused with the "C preprocessor",
which is an integral feature of the C, C++, Objective-C and
Objective-C++ languages.

2 Language Standards Supported by GCC
*************************************

For each language compiled by GCC for which there is a standard, GCC
attempts to follow one or more versions of that standard, possibly with
some exceptions, and possibly with some extensions.

2.1 C language
==============

GCC supports three versions of the C standard, although support for the
most recent version is not yet complete.

 The original ANSI C standard (X3.159-1989) was ratified in 1989 and
published in 1990.  This standard was ratified as an ISO standard
(ISO/IEC 9899:1990) later in 1990.  There were no technical differences
between these publications, although the sections of the ANSI standard
were renumbered and became clauses in the ISO standard.  This standard,
in both its forms, is commonly known as "C89", or occasionally as
"C90", from the dates of ratification.  The ANSI standard, but not the
ISO standard, also came with a Rationale document.  To select this
standard in GCC, use one of the options `-ansi', `-std=c90' or
`-std=iso9899:1990'; to obtain all the diagnostics required by the
standard, you should also specify `-pedantic' (or `-pedantic-errors' if
you want them to be errors rather than warnings).  *Note Options
Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options.

 Errors in the 1990 ISO C standard were corrected in two Technical
Corrigenda published in 1994 and 1996.  GCC does not support the
uncorrected version.

 An amendment to the 1990 standard was published in 1995.  This
amendment added digraphs and `__STDC_VERSION__' to the language, but
otherwise concerned the library.  This amendment is commonly known as
"AMD1"; the amended standard is sometimes known as "C94" or "C95".  To
select this standard in GCC, use the option `-std=iso9899:199409'
(with, as for other standard versions, `-pedantic' to receive all
required diagnostics).

 A new edition of the ISO C standard was published in 1999 as ISO/IEC
9899:1999, and is commonly known as "C99".  GCC has incomplete support
for this standard version; see
`http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.5/c99status.html' for details.  To select this
standard, use `-std=c99' or `-std=iso9899:1999'.  (While in
development, drafts of this standard version were referred to as "C9X".)

 Errors in the 1999 ISO C standard were corrected in three Technical
Corrigenda published in 2001, 2004 and 2007.  GCC does not support the
uncorrected version.

 By default, GCC provides some extensions to the C language that on
rare occasions conflict with the C standard.  *Note Extensions to the C
Language Family: C Extensions.  Use of the `-std' options listed above
will disable these extensions where they conflict with the C standard
version selected.  You may also select an extended version of the C
language explicitly with `-std=gnu90' (for C90 with GNU extensions) or
`-std=gnu99' (for C99 with GNU extensions).  The default, if no C
language dialect options are given, is `-std=gnu90'; this will change to
`-std=gnu99' in some future release when the C99 support is complete.
Some features that are part of the C99 standard are accepted as
extensions in C90 mode.

 The ISO C standard defines (in clause 4) two classes of conforming
implementation.  A "conforming hosted implementation" supports the
whole standard including all the library facilities; a "conforming
freestanding implementation" is only required to provide certain
library facilities: those in `<float.h>', `<limits.h>', `<stdarg.h>',
and `<stddef.h>'; since AMD1, also those in `<iso646.h>'; and in C99,
also those in `<stdbool.h>' and `<stdint.h>'.  In addition, complex
types, added in C99, are not required for freestanding implementations.
The standard also defines two environments for programs, a
"freestanding environment", required of all implementations and which
may not have library facilities beyond those required of freestanding
implementations, where the handling of program startup and termination
are implementation-defined, and a "hosted environment", which is not
required, in which all the library facilities are provided and startup
is through a function `int main (void)' or `int main (int, char *[])'.
An OS kernel would be a freestanding environment; a program using the
facilities of an operating system would normally be in a hosted
implementation.

 GCC aims towards being usable as a conforming freestanding
implementation, or as the compiler for a conforming hosted
implementation.  By default, it will act as the compiler for a hosted
implementation, defining `__STDC_HOSTED__' as `1' and presuming that
when the names of ISO C functions are used, they have the semantics
defined in the standard.  To make it act as a conforming freestanding
implementation for a freestanding environment, use the option
`-ffreestanding'; it will then define `__STDC_HOSTED__' to `0' and not
make assumptions about the meanings of function names from the standard
library, with exceptions noted below.  To build an OS kernel, you may
well still need to make your own arrangements for linking and startup.
*Note Options Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options.

 GCC does not provide the library facilities required only of hosted
implementations, nor yet all the facilities required by C99 of
freestanding implementations; to use the facilities of a hosted
environment, you will need to find them elsewhere (for example, in the
GNU C library).  *Note Standard Libraries: Standard Libraries.

 Most of the compiler support routines used by GCC are present in
`libgcc', but there are a few exceptions.  GCC requires the
freestanding environment provide `memcpy', `memmove', `memset' and
`memcmp'.  Finally, if `__builtin_trap' is used, and the target does
not implement the `trap' pattern, then GCC will emit a call to `abort'.

 For references to Technical Corrigenda, Rationale documents and
information concerning the history of C that is available online, see
`http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html'

2.2 C++ language
================

GCC supports the ISO C++ standard (1998) and contains experimental
support for the upcoming ISO C++ standard (200x).

 The original ISO C++ standard was published as the ISO standard
(ISO/IEC 14882:1998) and amended by a Technical Corrigenda published in
2003 (ISO/IEC 14882:2003). These standards are referred to as C++98 and
C++03, respectively. GCC implements the majority of C++98 (`export' is
a notable exception) and most of the changes in C++03.  To select this
standard in GCC, use one of the options `-ansi' or `-std=c++98'; to
obtain all the diagnostics required by the standard, you should also
specify `-pedantic' (or `-pedantic-errors' if you want them to be
errors rather than warnings).

 The ISO C++ committee is working on a new ISO C++ standard, dubbed
C++0x, that is intended to be published by 2009. C++0x contains several
changes to the C++ language, some of which have been implemented in an
experimental C++0x mode in GCC. The C++0x mode in GCC tracks the draft
working paper for the C++0x standard; the latest working paper is
available on the ISO C++ committee's web site at
`http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/'. For information regarding
the C++0x features available in the experimental C++0x mode, see
`http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html'. To select this standard in
GCC, use the option `-std=c++0x'; to obtain all the diagnostics
required by the standard, you should also specify `-pedantic' (or
`-pedantic-errors' if you want them to be errors rather than warnings).

 By default, GCC provides some extensions to the C++ language; *Note
Options Controlling C++ Dialect: C++ Dialect Options.  Use of the
`-std' option listed above will disable these extensions.  You may also
select an extended version of the C++ language explicitly with
`-std=gnu++98' (for C++98 with GNU extensions) or `-std=gnu++0x' (for
C++0x with GNU extensions).  The default, if no C++ language dialect
options are given, is `-std=gnu++98'.

2.3 Objective-C and Objective-C++ languages
===========================================

There is no formal written standard for Objective-C or Objective-C++.
The most authoritative manual is "Object-Oriented Programming and the
Objective-C Language", available at a number of web sites:

   *
     `http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/'
     is a recent (and periodically updated) version;

   * `http://objc.toodarkpark.net' is an older example;

   * `http://www.gnustep.org' and `http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html'
     have additional useful information.

 *Note GNAT Reference Manual: (gnat_rm)Top, for information on standard
conformance and compatibility of the Ada compiler.

 *Note Standards: (gfortran)Standards, for details of standards
supported by GNU Fortran.

 *Note Compatibility with the Java Platform: (gcj)Compatibility, for
details of compatibility between `gcj' and the Java Platform.

3 GCC Command Options
*********************

When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the `-c' option says
not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output
by the assembler.

 Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

 Most of the command line options that you can use with GCC are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.

 *Note Compiling C++ Programs: Invoking G++, for a summary of special
options for compiling C++ programs.

 The `gcc' program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
options may _not_ be grouped: `-dv' is very different from `-d -v'.

 You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify `-L' more than once, the
directories are searched in the order specified.  Also, the placement
of the `-l' option is significant.

 Many options have long names starting with `-f' or with `-W'--for
example, `-fmove-loop-invariants', `-Wformat' and so on.  Most of these
have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of `-ffoo'
would be `-fno-foo'.  This manual documents only one of these two
forms, whichever one is not the default.

3.2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output
==========================================

Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  GCC is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several assembler
input files, or into one assembler input file; then each assembler
input file produces an object file, and linking combines all the object
files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input) into an
executable file.

 For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

`FILE.c'
     C source code which must be preprocessed.

`FILE.i'
     C source code which should not be preprocessed.

`FILE.ii'
     C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.

`FILE.m'
     Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the
     `libobjc' library to make an Objective-C program work.

`FILE.mi'
     Objective-C source code which should not be preprocessed.

`FILE.mm'
`FILE.M'
     Objective-C++ source code.  Note that you must link with the
     `libobjc' library to make an Objective-C++ program work.  Note
     that `.M' refers to a literal capital M.

`FILE.mii'
     Objective-C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.

`FILE.h'

     a precompiled header.

`FILE.cc'
`FILE.cp'
`FILE.cxx'
`FILE.cpp'
`FILE.CPP'
`FILE.c++'
`FILE.C'
     C++ source code which must be preprocessed.  Note that in `.cxx',
     the last two letters must both be literally `x'.  Likewise, `.C'
     refers to a literal capital C.

`FILE.mm'
`FILE.M'
     Objective-C++ source code which must be preprocessed.

`FILE.mii'
     Objective-C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.

`FILE.hh'
`FILE.H'
`FILE.hp'
`FILE.hxx'
`FILE.hpp'
`FILE.HPP'
`FILE.h++'
`FILE.tcc'
     C++ header file to be turned into a precompiled header.

`FILE.f'
`FILE.for'
`FILE.ftn'
     Fixed form Fortran source code which should not be preprocessed.

`FILE.F'
`FILE.FOR'
`FILE.fpp'
`FILE.FPP'
`FILE.FTN'
     Fixed form Fortran source code which must be preprocessed (with
     the traditional preprocessor).

`FILE.f90'
`FILE.f95'
`FILE.f03'
`FILE.f08'
     Free form Fortran source code which should not be preprocessed.

`FILE.F90'
`FILE.F95'
`FILE.F03'
`FILE.F08'
     Free form Fortran source code which must be preprocessed (with the
     traditional preprocessor).

`FILE.ads'
     Ada source code file which contains a library unit declaration (a
     declaration of a package, subprogram, or generic, or a generic
     instantiation), or a library unit renaming declaration (a package,
     generic, or subprogram renaming declaration).  Such files are also
     called "specs".

`FILE.adb'
     Ada source code file containing a library unit body (a subprogram
     or package body).  Such files are also called "bodies".

`FILE.s'
     Assembler code.

`FILE.S'
`FILE.sx'
     Assembler code which must be preprocessed.

`OTHER'
     An object file to be fed straight into linking.  Any file name
     with no recognized suffix is treated this way.

 You can specify the input language explicitly with the `-x' option:

`-x LANGUAGE'
     Specify explicitly the LANGUAGE for the following input files
     (rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the
     file name suffix).  This option applies to all following input
     files until the next `-x' option.  Possible values for LANGUAGE
     are:
          c  c-header  c-cpp-output
          c++  c++-header  c++-cpp-output
          objective-c  objective-c-header  objective-c-cpp-output
          objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output
          assembler  assembler-with-cpp
          ada
          f77  f77-cpp-input f95  f95-cpp-input
          java

`-x none'
     Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files
     are handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if
     `-x' has not been used at all).

`-pass-exit-codes'
     Normally the `gcc' program will exit with the code of 1 if any
     phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you
     specify `-pass-exit-codes', the `gcc' program will instead return
     with numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned
     an error indication.  The C, C++, and Fortran frontends return 4,
     if an internal compiler error is encountered.

 If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use `-x'
(or filename suffixes) to tell `gcc' where to start, and one of the
options `-c', `-S', or `-E' to say where `gcc' is to stop.  Note that
some combinations (for example, `-x cpp-output -E') instruct `gcc' to
do nothing at all.

`-c'
     Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
     stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
     object file for each source file.

     By default, the object file name for a source file is made by
     replacing the suffix `.c', `.i', `.s', etc., with `.o'.

     Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly,
     are ignored.

`-S'
     Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The
     output is in the form of an assembler code file for each
     non-assembler input file specified.

     By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
     replacing the suffix `.c', `.i', etc., with `.s'.

     Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

`-E'
     Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler
     proper.  The output is in the form of preprocessed source code,
     which is sent to the standard output.

     Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.

`-o FILE'
     Place output in file FILE.  This applies regardless to whatever
     sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
     an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

     If `-o' is not specified, the default is to put an executable file
     in `a.out', the object file for `SOURCE.SUFFIX' in `SOURCE.o', its
     assembler file in `SOURCE.s', a precompiled header file in
     `SOURCE.SUFFIX.gch', and all preprocessed C source on standard
     output.

`-v'
     Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the
     stages of compilation.  Also print the version number of the
     compiler driver program and of the preprocessor and the compiler
     proper.

`-###'
     Like `-v' except the commands are not executed and all command
     arguments are quoted.  This is useful for shell scripts to capture
     the driver-generated command lines.

`-pipe'
     Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
     various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems
     where the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU
     assembler has no trouble.

`-combine'
     If you are compiling multiple source files, this option tells the
     driver to pass all the source files to the compiler at once (for
     those languages for which the compiler can handle this).  This
     will allow intermodule analysis (IMA) to be performed by the
     compiler.  Currently the only language for which this is supported
     is C.  If you pass source files for multiple languages to the
     driver, using this option, the driver will invoke the compiler(s)
     that support IMA once each, passing each compiler all the source
     files appropriate for it.  For those languages that do not support
     IMA this option will be ignored, and the compiler will be invoked
     once for each source file in that language.  If you use this
     option in conjunction with `-save-temps', the compiler will
     generate multiple pre-processed files (one for each source file),
     but only one (combined) `.o' or `.s' file.

`--help'
     Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line
     options understood by `gcc'.  If the `-v' option is also specified
     then `--help' will also be passed on to the various processes
     invoked by `gcc', so that they can display the command line options
     they accept.  If the `-Wextra' option has also been specified
     (prior to the `--help' option), then command line options which
     have no documentation associated with them will also be displayed.

`--target-help'
     Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific
     command line options for each tool.  For some targets extra
     target-specific information may also be printed.

`--help={CLASS|[^]QUALIFIER}[,...]'
     Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line
     options understood by the compiler that fit into all specified
     classes and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:

    `optimizers'
          This will display all of the optimization options supported
          by the compiler.

    `warnings'
          This will display all of the options controlling warning
          messages produced by the compiler.

    `target'
          This will display target-specific options.  Unlike the
          `--target-help' option however, target-specific options of the
          linker and assembler will not be displayed.  This is because
          those tools do not currently support the extended `--help='
          syntax.

    `params'
          This will display the values recognized by the `--param'
          option.

    LANGUAGE
          This will display the options supported for LANGUAGE, where
          LANGUAGE is the name of one of the languages supported in this
          version of GCC.

    `common'
          This will display the options that are common to all
          languages.

     These are the supported qualifiers:

    `undocumented'
          Display only those options which are undocumented.

    `joined'
          Display options which take an argument that appears after an
          equal sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
          `--help=target'.

    `separate'
          Display options which take an argument that appears as a
          separate word following the original option, such as: `-o
          output-file'.

     Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
     switches supported by the compiler the following can be used:

          --help=target,undocumented

     The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
     `^' character, so for example to display all binary warning
     options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take
     an argument), which have a description the following can be used:

          --help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented

     The argument to `--help=' should not consist solely of inverted
     qualifiers.

     Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
     restricts the output by so much that there is nothing to display.
     One case where it does work however is when one of the classes is
     TARGET.  So for example to display all the target-specific
     optimization options the following can be used:

          --help=target,optimizers

     The `--help=' option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
     successive use will display its requested class of options,
     skipping those that have already been displayed.

     If the `-Q' option appears on the command line before the
     `--help=' option, then the descriptive text displayed by `--help='
     is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed options, an
     indication is given as to whether the option is enabled, disabled
     or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler knows this
     at the point where the `--help=' option is used).

     Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of `gcc':

            % gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target -c
            The following options are target specific:
            -mabi=                                2
            -mabort-on-noreturn                   [disabled]
            -mapcs                                [disabled]

     The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command line
     options, so for example it is possible to find out which
     optimizations are enabled at `-O2' by using:

          -Q -O2 --help=optimizers

     Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are
     enabled by `-O3' by using:

          gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers > /tmp/O3-opts
          gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers > /tmp/O2-opts
          diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled

`-no-canonical-prefixes'
     Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to `/../' or
     `/./', or make the path absolute when generating a relative prefix.

`--version'
     Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked GCC.

`-wrapper'
     Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program. It takes a single
     comma separated list as an argument, which will be used to invoke
     the wrapper:

          gcc -c t.c -wrapper gdb,--args

     This will invoke all subprograms of gcc under "gdb -args", thus
     cc1 invocation will be "gdb -args cc1 ...".

`-fplugin=NAME.so'
     Load the plugin code in file NAME.so, assumed to be a shared
     object to be dlopen'd by the compiler.  The base name of the
     shared object file is used to identify the plugin for the purposes
     of argument parsing (See `-fplugin-arg-NAME-KEY=VALUE' below).
     Each plugin should define the callback functions specified in the
     Plugins API.

`-fplugin-arg-NAME-KEY=VALUE'
     Define an argument called KEY with a value of VALUE for the plugin
     called NAME.

`@FILE'
     Read command-line options from FILE.  The options read are
     inserted in place of the original @FILE option.  If FILE does not
     exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
     literally, and not removed.

     Options in FILE are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
     character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
     option in either single or double quotes.  Any character
     (including a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character
     to be included with a backslash.  The FILE may itself contain
     additional @FILE options; any such options will be processed
     recursively.

3.3 Compiling C++ Programs
==========================

C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes `.C', `.cc',
`.cpp', `.CPP', `.c++', `.cp', or `.cxx'; C++ header files often use
`.hh', `.hpp', `.H', or (for shared template code) `.tcc'; and
preprocessed C++ files use the suffix `.ii'.  GCC recognizes files with
these names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you call the
compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually with the
name `gcc').

 However, the use of `gcc' does not add the C++ library.  `g++' is a
program that calls GCC and treats `.c', `.h' and `.i' files as C++
source files instead of C source files unless `-x' is used, and
automatically specifies linking against the C++ library.  This program
is also useful when precompiling a C header file with a `.h' extension
for use in C++ compilations.  On many systems, `g++' is also installed
with the name `c++'.

 When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.  *Note
Options Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options, for explanations of
options for languages related to C.  *Note Options Controlling C++
Dialect: C++ Dialect Options, for explanations of options that are
meaningful only for C++ programs.


File: gcc.info,  Node: C Dialect Options,  Next: C++ Dialect Options,  Prev: Invoking G++,  Up: Invoking GCC

3.4 Options Controlling C Dialect
=================================

The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++) that the compiler
accepts:

`-ansi'
     In C mode, this is equivalent to `-std=c90'. In C++ mode, it is
     equivalent to `-std=c++98'.

     This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with
     ISO C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when
     compiling C++ code), such as the `asm' and `typeof' keywords, and
     predefined macros such as `unix' and `vax' that identify the type
     of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
     rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For the C compiler, it disables
     recognition of C++ style `//' comments as well as the `inline'
     keyword.

     The alternate keywords `__asm__', `__extension__', `__inline__'
     and `__typeof__' continue to work despite `-ansi'.  You would not
     want to use them in an ISO C program, of course, but it is useful
     to put them in header files that might be included in compilations
     done with `-ansi'.  Alternate predefined macros such as `__unix__'
     and `__vax__' are also available, with or without `-ansi'.

     The `-ansi' option does not cause non-ISO programs to be rejected
     gratuitously.  For that, `-pedantic' is required in addition to
     `-ansi'.  *Note Warning Options::.

     The macro `__STRICT_ANSI__' is predefined when the `-ansi' option
     is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain from
     declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
     ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with
     any programs that might use these names for other things.

     Functions that would normally be built in but do not have semantics
     defined by ISO C (such as `alloca' and `ffs') are not built-in
     functions when `-ansi' is used.  *Note Other built-in functions
     provided by GCC: Other Builtins, for details of the functions
     affected.

`-std='
     Determine the language standard. *Note Language Standards
     Supported by GCC: Standards, for details of these standard
     versions.  This option is currently only supported when compiling
     C or C++.

     The compiler can accept several base standards, such as `c90' or
     `c++98', and GNU dialects of those standards, such as `gnu90' or
     `gnu++98'.  By specifying a base standard, the compiler will
     accept all programs following that standard and those using GNU
     extensions that do not contradict it.  For example, `-std=c90'
     turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO
     C90, such as the `asm' and `typeof' keywords, but not other GNU
     extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90, such as omitting
     the middle term of a `?:' expression. On the other hand, by
     specifying a GNU dialect of a standard, all features the compiler
     support are enabled, even when those features change the meaning
     of the base standard and some strict-conforming programs may be
     rejected.  The particular standard is used by `-pedantic' to
     identify which features are GNU extensions given that version of
     the standard. For example `-std=gnu90 -pedantic' would warn about
     C++ style `//' comments, while `-std=gnu99 -pedantic' would not.

     A value for this option must be provided; possible values are

    `c90'
    `c89'
    `iso9899:1990'
          Support all ISO C90 programs (certain GNU extensions that
          conflict with ISO C90 are disabled). Same as `-ansi' for C
          code.

    `iso9899:199409'
          ISO C90 as modified in amendment 1.

    `c99'
    `c9x'
    `iso9899:1999'
    `iso9899:199x'
          ISO C99.  Note that this standard is not yet fully supported;
          see `http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.5/c99status.html' for more
          information.  The names `c9x' and `iso9899:199x' are
          deprecated.

    `gnu90'
    `gnu89'
          GNU dialect of ISO C90 (including some C99 features). This is
          the default for C code.

    `gnu99'
    `gnu9x'
          GNU dialect of ISO C99.  When ISO C99 is fully implemented in
          GCC, this will become the default.  The name `gnu9x' is
          deprecated.

    `c++98'
          The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments. Same as `-ansi' for
          C++ code.

    `gnu++98'
          GNU dialect of `-std=c++98'.  This is the default for C++
          code.

    `c++0x'
          The working draft of the upcoming ISO C++0x standard. This
          option enables experimental features that are likely to be
          included in C++0x. The working draft is constantly changing,
          and any feature that is enabled by this flag may be removed
          from future versions of GCC if it is not part of the C++0x
          standard.

    `gnu++0x'
          GNU dialect of `-std=c++0x'. This option enables experimental
          features that may be removed in future versions of GCC.

`-fgnu89-inline'
     The option `-fgnu89-inline' tells GCC to use the traditional GNU
     semantics for `inline' functions when in C99 mode.  *Note An
     Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro: Inline.  This option is
     accepted and ignored by GCC versions 4.1.3 up to but not including
     4.3.  In GCC versions 4.3 and later it changes the behavior of GCC
     in C99 mode.  Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the
     `gnu_inline' function attribute to all inline functions (*note
     Function Attributes::).

     The option `-fno-gnu89-inline' explicitly tells GCC to use the C99
     semantics for `inline' when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it
     specifies the default behavior).  This option was first supported
     in GCC 4.3.  This option is not supported in `-std=c90' or
     `-std=gnu90' mode.

     The preprocessor macros `__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__' and
     `__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__' may be used to check which semantics are in
     effect for `inline' functions.  *Note Common Predefined Macros:
     (cpp)Common Predefined Macros.

`-aux-info FILENAME'
     Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all
     functions declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including
     those in header files.  This option is silently ignored in any
     language other than C.

     Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin
     of each declaration (source file and line), whether the
     declaration was implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (`I', `N' for
     new or `O' for old, respectively, in the first character after the
     line number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration
     or a definition (`C' or `F', respectively, in the following
     character).  In the case of function definitions, a K&R-style list
     of arguments followed by their declarations is also provided,
     inside comments, after the declaration.

`-fno-asm'
     Do not recognize `asm', `inline' or `typeof' as a keyword, so that
     code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use the keywords
     `__asm__', `__inline__' and `__typeof__' instead.  `-ansi' implies
     `-fno-asm'.

     In C++, this switch only affects the `typeof' keyword, since `asm'
     and `inline' are standard keywords.  You may want to use the
     `-fno-gnu-keywords' flag instead, which has the same effect.  In
     C99 mode (`-std=c99' or `-std=gnu99'), this switch only affects
     the `asm' and `typeof' keywords, since `inline' is a standard
     keyword in ISO C99.

`-fno-builtin'
`-fno-builtin-FUNCTION'
     Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
     `__builtin_' as prefix.  *Note Other built-in functions provided
     by GCC: Other Builtins, for details of the functions affected,
     including those which are not built-in functions when `-ansi' or
     `-std' options for strict ISO C conformance are used because they
     do not have an ISO standard meaning.

     GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in
     functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to `alloca' may
     become single instructions that adjust the stack directly, and
     calls to `memcpy' may become inline copy loops.  The resulting
     code is often both smaller and faster, but since the function
     calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on
     those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by
     linking with a different library.  In addition, when a function is
     recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use information about
     that function to warn about problems with calls to that function,
     or to generate more efficient code, even if the resulting code
     still contains calls to that function.  For example, warnings are
     given with `-Wformat' for bad calls to `printf', when `printf' is
     built in, and `strlen' is known not to modify global memory.

     With the `-fno-builtin-FUNCTION' option only the built-in function
     FUNCTION is disabled.  FUNCTION must not begin with `__builtin_'.
     If a function is named that is not built-in in this version of
     GCC, this option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
     `-fbuiltin-FUNCTION' option; if you wish to enable built-in
     functions selectively when using `-fno-builtin' or
     `-ffreestanding', you may define macros such as:

          #define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
          #define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))

`-fhosted'
     Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.  This
     implies `-fbuiltin'.  A hosted environment is one in which the
     entire standard library is available, and in which `main' has a
     return type of `int'.  Examples are nearly everything except a
     kernel.  This is equivalent to `-fno-freestanding'.

`-ffreestanding'
     Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.
     This implies `-fno-builtin'.  A freestanding environment is one in
     which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
     not necessarily be at `main'.  The most obvious example is an OS
     kernel.  This is equivalent to `-fno-hosted'.

     *Note Language Standards Supported by GCC: Standards, for details
     of freestanding and hosted environments.

`-fopenmp'
     Enable handling of OpenMP directives `#pragma omp' in C/C++ and
     `!$omp' in Fortran.  When `-fopenmp' is specified, the compiler
     generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application
     Program Interface v3.0 `http://www.openmp.org/'.  This option
     implies `-pthread', and thus is only supported on targets that
     have support for `-pthread'.

`-fms-extensions'
     Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

     Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only
     accepted with this option.  *Note Unnamed struct/union fields
     within structs/unions: Unnamed Fields, for details.

`-trigraphs'
     Support ISO C trigraphs.  The `-ansi' option (and `-std' options
     for strict ISO C conformance) implies `-trigraphs'.

`-no-integrated-cpp'
     Performs a compilation in two passes: preprocessing and compiling.
     This option allows a user supplied "cc1", "cc1plus", or "cc1obj"
     via the `-B' option.  The user supplied compilation step can then
     add in an additional preprocessing step after normal preprocessing
     but before compiling.  The default is to use the integrated cpp
     (internal cpp)

     The semantics of this option will change if "cc1", "cc1plus", and
     "cc1obj" are merged.

`-traditional'
`-traditional-cpp'
     Formerly, these options caused GCC to attempt to emulate a
     pre-standard C compiler.  They are now only supported with the
     `-E' switch.  The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard
     mode.  See the GNU CPP manual for details.

`-fcond-mismatch'
     Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second
     and third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.
     This option is not supported for C++.

`-flax-vector-conversions'
     Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing numbers
     of elements and/or incompatible element types.  This option should
     not be used for new code.

`-funsigned-char'
     Let the type `char' be unsigned, like `unsigned char'.

     Each kind of machine has a default for what `char' should be.  It
     is either like `unsigned char' by default or like `signed char' by
     default.

     Ideally, a portable program should always use `signed char' or
     `unsigned char' when it depends on the signedness of an object.
     But many programs have been written to use plain `char' and expect
     it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
     machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let
     you make such a program work with the opposite default.

     The type `char' is always a distinct type from each of `signed
     char' or `unsigned char', even though its behavior is always just
     like one of those two.

`-fsigned-char'
     Let the type `char' be signed, like `signed char'.

     Note that this is equivalent to `-fno-unsigned-char', which is the
     negative form of `-funsigned-char'.  Likewise, the option
     `-fno-signed-char' is equivalent to `-funsigned-char'.

`-fsigned-bitfields'
`-funsigned-bitfields'
`-fno-signed-bitfields'
`-fno-unsigned-bitfields'
     These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned,
     when the declaration does not use either `signed' or `unsigned'.
     By default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is
     consistent: the basic integer types such as `int' are signed types.

3.5 Options Controlling C++ Dialect
===================================

This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs; but you can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you might
compile a file `firstClass.C' like this:

     g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C

In this example, only `-frepo' is an option meant only for C++
programs; you can use the other options with any language supported by
GCC.

 Here is a list of options that are _only_ for compiling C++ programs:

`-fabi-version=N'
     Use version N of the C++ ABI.  Version 2 is the version of the C++
     ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.4.  Version 1 is the version of
     the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.  Version 0 will always
     be the version that conforms most closely to the C++ ABI
     specification.  Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0 will
     change as ABI bugs are fixed.

     The default is version 2.

     Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
     template argument.

     Version 4 implements a standard mangling for vector types.

     See also `-Wabi'.

`-fno-access-control'
     Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for
     working around bugs in the access control code.

`-fcheck-new'
     Check that the pointer returned by `operator new' is non-null
     before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
     normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
     `operator new' will only return `0' if it is declared `throw()',
     in which case the compiler will always check the return value even
     without this option.  In all other cases, when `operator new' has
     a non-empty exception specification, memory exhaustion is
     signalled by throwing `std::bad_alloc'.  See also `new (nothrow)'.

`-fconserve-space'
     Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
     common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at
     the cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile
     with this flag and your program mysteriously crashes after
     `main()' has completed, you may have an object that is being
     destroyed twice because two definitions were merged.

     This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support
     has been added for putting variables into BSS without making them
     common.

`-fno-deduce-init-list'
     Disable deduction of a template type parameter as
     std::initializer_list from a brace-enclosed initializer list, i.e.

          template <class T> auto forward(T t) -> decltype (realfn (t))
          {
            return realfn (t);
          }

          void f()
          {
            forward({1,2}); // call forward<std::initializer_list<int>>
          }

     This option is present because this deduction is an extension to
     the current specification in the C++0x working draft, and there was
     some concern about potential overload resolution problems.

`-ffriend-injection'
     Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they
     are visible outside the scope of the class in which they are
     declared.  Friend functions were documented to work this way in
     the old Annotated C++ Reference Manual, and versions of G++ before
     4.1 always worked that way.  However, in ISO C++ a friend function
     which is not declared in an enclosing scope can only be found
     using argument dependent lookup.  This option causes friends to be
     injected as they were in earlier releases.

     This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
     release of G++.

`-fno-elide-constructors'
     The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a
     temporary which is only used to initialize another object of the
     same type.  Specifying this option disables that optimization, and
     forces G++ to call the copy constructor in all cases.

`-fno-enforce-eh-specs'
     Don't generate code to check for violation of exception
     specifications at runtime.  This option violates the C++ standard,
     but may be useful for reducing code size in production builds,
     much like defining `NDEBUG'.  This does not give user code
     permission to throw exceptions in violation of the exception
     specifications; the compiler will still optimize based on the
     specifications, so throwing an unexpected exception will result in
     undefined behavior.

`-ffor-scope'
`-fno-for-scope'
     If `-ffor-scope' is specified, the scope of variables declared in
     a for-init-statement is limited to the `for' loop itself, as
     specified by the C++ standard.  If `-fno-for-scope' is specified,
     the scope of variables declared in a for-init-statement extends to
     the end of the enclosing scope, as was the case in old versions of
     G++, and other (traditional) implementations of C++.

     The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard, but
     to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
     otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.

`-fno-gnu-keywords'
     Do not recognize `typeof' as a keyword, so that code can use this
     word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword `__typeof__'
     instead.  `-ansi' implies `-fno-gnu-keywords'.

`-fno-implicit-templates'
     Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated
     implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit
     instantiations.  *Note Template Instantiation::, for more
     information.

`-fno-implicit-inline-templates'
     Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates,
     either.  The default is to handle inlines differently so that
     compiles with and without optimization will need the same set of
     explicit instantiations.

`-fno-implement-inlines'
     To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
     controlled by `#pragma implementation'.  This will cause linker
     errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are
     called.

`-fms-extensions'
     Disable pedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as
     implicit int and getting a pointer to member function via
     non-standard syntax.

`-fno-nonansi-builtins'
     Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
     ANSI/ISO C.  These include `ffs', `alloca', `_exit', `index',
     `bzero', `conjf', and other related functions.

`-fno-operator-names'
     Do not treat the operator name keywords `and', `bitand', `bitor',
     `compl', `not', `or' and `xor' as synonyms as keywords.

`-fno-optional-diags'
     Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not
     need to issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++
     is the one for a name having multiple meanings within a class.

`-fpermissive'
     Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
     warnings.  Thus, using `-fpermissive' will allow some
     nonconforming code to compile.

`-fno-pretty-templates'
     When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
     template, the compiler will normally print the signature of the
     template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
     typenames in the signature (e.g. `void f(T) [with T = int]' rather
     than `void f(int)') so that it's clear which template is involved.
     When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
     template, the compiler will omit any template arguments which match
     the default template arguments for that template.  If either of
     these behaviors make it harder to understand the error message
     rather than easier, using `-fno-pretty-templates' will disable
     them.

`-frepo'
     Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option
     also implies `-fno-implicit-templates'.  *Note Template
     Instantiation::, for more information.

`-fno-rtti'
     Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
     functions for use by the C++ runtime type identification features
     (`dynamic_cast' and `typeid').  If you don't use those parts of
     the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note
     that exception handling uses the same information, but it will
     generate it as needed. The `dynamic_cast' operator can still be
     used for casts that do not require runtime type information, i.e.
     casts to `void *' or to unambiguous base classes.

`-fstats'
     Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the
     compilation.  This information is generally only useful to the G++
     development team.

`-ftemplate-depth=N'
     Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to N.  A
     limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
     endless recursions during template class instantiation.  ANSI/ISO
     C++ conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater
     than 17 (changed to 1024 in C++0x).

`-fno-threadsafe-statics'
     Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the C++
     ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use
     this option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need
     to be thread-safe.

`-fuse-cxa-atexit'
     Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with
     the `__cxa_atexit' function rather than the `atexit' function.
     This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of
     static destructors, but will only work if your C library supports
     `__cxa_atexit'.

`-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr'
     Don't use the `__cxa_get_exception_ptr' runtime routine.  This
     will cause `std::uncaught_exception' to be incorrect, but is
     necessary if the runtime routine is not available.

`-fvisibility-inlines-hidden'
     This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
     pointers to inline methods where the addresses of the two functions
     were taken in different shared objects.

     The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline
     methods with `__attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))' so that
     they do not appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require
     a PLT indirection when used within the DSO.  Enabling this option
     can have a dramatic effect on load and link times of a DSO as it
     massively reduces the size of the dynamic export table when the
     library makes heavy use of templates.

     The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
     methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static
     variables local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce
     that the function is defined in only one shared object.

     You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate
     the effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do
     want to compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might
     mark it as having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class
     with explicit visibility will have no effect.

     Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this
     option as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library
     boundary.  *Note Template Instantiation::.

`-fvisibility-ms-compat'
     This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC's C++
     linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.

     The flag makes these changes to GCC's linkage model:

       1. It sets the default visibility to `hidden', like
          `-fvisibility=hidden'.

       2. Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.

       3. The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
          visibility specifications which are defined in more than one
          different shared object: those declarations are permitted if
          they would have been permitted when this option was not used.

     In new code it is better to use `-fvisibility=hidden' and export
     those classes which are intended to be externally visible.
     Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps
     accidentally, on the Visual Studio behavior.

     Among the consequences of these changes are that static data
     members of the same type with the same name but defined in
     different shared objects will be different, so changing one will
     not change the other; and that pointers to function members
     defined in different shared objects may not compare equal.  When
     this flag is given, it is a violation of the ODR to define types
     with the same name differently.

`-fno-weak'
     Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the
     linker.  By default, G++ will use weak symbols if they are
     available.  This option exists only for testing, and should not be
     used by end-users; it will result in inferior code and has no
     benefits.  This option may be removed in a future release of G++.

`-nostdinc++'
     Do not search for header files in the standard directories
     specific to C++, but do still search the other standard
     directories.  (This option is used when building the C++ library.)

 In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:

`-fno-default-inline'
     Do not assume `inline' for functions defined inside a class scope.
     *Note Options That Control Optimization: Optimize Options.  Note
     that these functions will have linkage like inline functions; they
     just won't be inlined by default.

`-Wabi (C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with
     the vendor-neutral C++ ABI.  Although an effort has been made to
     warn about all such cases, there are probably some cases that are
     not warned about, even though G++ is generating incompatible code.
     There may also be cases where warnings are emitted even though the
     code that is generated will be compatible.

     You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
     concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be
     binary compatible with code generated by other compilers.

     The known incompatibilities in `-fabi-version=2' (the default)
     include:

        * A template with a non-type template parameter of reference
          type is mangled incorrectly:
               extern int N;
               template <int &> struct S {};
               void n (S<N>) {2}

          This is fixed in `-fabi-version=3'.

        * SIMD vector types declared using `__attribute
          ((vector_size))' are mangled in a non-standard way that does
          not allow for overloading of functions taking vectors of
          different sizes.

          The mangling is changed in `-fabi-version=4'.

     The known incompatibilities in `-fabi-version=1' include:

        * Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may
          attempt to pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For
          example:

               struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
               struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };

          In this case, G++ will place `B::f2' into the same byte
          as`A::f1'; other compilers will not.  You can avoid this
          problem by explicitly padding `A' so that its size is a
          multiple of the byte size on your platform; that will cause
          G++ and other compilers to layout `B' identically.

        * Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++
          does not use tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For
          example:

               struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
               struct B { B(); char c2; };
               struct C : public A, public virtual B {};

          In this case, G++ will not place `B' into the tail-padding for
          `A'; other compilers will.  You can avoid this problem by
          explicitly padding `A' so that its size is a multiple of its
          alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that will cause
          G++ and other compilers to layout `C' identically.

        * Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater
          than that of their underlying types, when the bit-fields
          appear in a union.  For example:

               union U { int i : 4096; };

          Assuming that an `int' does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make
          the union too small by the number of bits in an `int'.

        * Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For
          example:

               struct A {};

               struct B {
                 A a;
                 virtual void f ();
               };

               struct C : public B, public A {};

          G++ will place the `A' base class of `C' at a nonzero offset;
          it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes
          that the `A' data member of `B' is already at offset zero.

        * Names of template functions whose types involve `typename' or
          template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.

               template <typename Q>
               void f(typename Q::X) {}

               template <template <typename> class Q>
               void f(typename Q<int>::X) {}

          Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.


     It also warns psABI related changes.  The known psABI changes at
     this point include:

        * For SYSV/x86-64, when passing union with long double, it is
          changed to pass in memory as specified in psABI.  For example:

               union U {
                 long double ld;
                 int i;
               };

          `union U' will always be passed in memory.


`-Wctor-dtor-privacy (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or
     destructors in that class are private, and it has neither friends
     nor public static member functions.

`-Wnon-virtual-dtor (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when a class has virtual functions and accessible non-virtual
     destructor, in which case it would be possible but unsafe to delete
     an instance of a derived class through a pointer to the base class.
     This warning is also enabled if -Weffc++ is specified.

`-Wreorder (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does
     not match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:

          struct A {
            int i;
            int j;
            A(): j (0), i (1) { }
          };

     The compiler will rearrange the member initializers for `i' and
     `j' to match the declaration order of the members, emitting a
     warning to that effect.  This warning is enabled by `-Wall'.

 The following `-W...' options are not affected by `-Wall'.

`-Weffc++ (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott
     Meyers' `Effective C++' book:

        * Item 11:  Define a copy constructor and an assignment
          operator for classes with dynamically allocated memory.

        * Item 12:  Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.

        * Item 14:  Make destructors virtual in base classes.

        * Item 15:  Have `operator=' return a reference to `*this'.

        * Item 23:  Don't try to return a reference when you must
          return an object.


     Also warn about violations of the following style guidelines from
     Scott Meyers' `More Effective C++' book:

        * Item 6:  Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of
          increment and decrement operators.

        * Item 7:  Never overload `&&', `||', or `,'.


     When selecting this option, be aware that the standard library
     headers do not obey all of these guidelines; use `grep -v' to
     filter out those warnings.

`-Wstrict-null-sentinel (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn also about the use of an uncasted `NULL' as sentinel.  When
     compiling only with GCC this is a valid sentinel, as `NULL' is
     defined to `__null'.  Although it is a null pointer constant not a
     null pointer, it is guaranteed to be of the same size as a
     pointer.  But this use is not portable across different compilers.

`-Wno-non-template-friend (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
     within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template
     specification support in G++, if the name of the friend is an
     unqualified-id (i.e., `friend foo(int)'), the C++ language
     specification demands that the friend declare or define an
     ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section 14.5.3).  Before G++
     implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids could be
     interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
     function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the
     default behavior for G++, `-Wnon-template-friend' allows the
     compiler to check existing code for potential trouble spots and is
     on by default.  This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
     `-Wno-non-template-friend' which keeps the conformant compiler code
     but disables the helpful warning.

`-Wold-style-cast (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used
     within a C++ program.  The new-style casts (`dynamic_cast',
     `static_cast', `reinterpret_cast', and `const_cast') are less
     vulnerable to unintended effects and much easier to search for.

`-Woverloaded-virtual (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
     base class.  For example, in:

          struct A {
            virtual void f();
          };

          struct B: public A {
            void f(int);
          };

     the `A' class version of `f' is hidden in `B', and code like:

          B* b;
          b->f();

     will fail to compile.

`-Wno-pmf-conversions (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member
     function to a plain pointer.

`-Wsign-promo (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
     enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned
     type of the same size.  Previous versions of G++ would try to
     preserve unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current
     behavior.

          struct A {
            operator int ();
            A& operator = (int);
          };

          main ()
          {
            A a,b;
            a = b;
          }

     In this example, G++ will synthesize a default `A& operator =
     (const A&);', while cfront will use the user-defined `operator ='.

3.6 Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialects
==============================================================

(NOTE: This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective-C++
languages themselves.  See *Note Language Standards Supported by GCC:
Standards, for references.)

 This section describes the command-line options that are only
meaningful for Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs, but you can also
use most of the language-independent GNU compiler options.  For
example, you might compile a file `some_class.m' like this:

     gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m

In this example, `-fgnu-runtime' is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs; you can use the other options
with any language supported by GCC.

 Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language,
Objective-C compilations may also use options specific to the C
front-end (e.g., `-Wtraditional').  Similarly, Objective-C++
compilations may use C++-specific options (e.g., `-Wabi').

 Here is a list of options that are _only_ for compiling Objective-C
and Objective-C++ programs:

`-fconstant-string-class=CLASS-NAME'
     Use CLASS-NAME as the name of the class to instantiate for each
     literal string specified with the syntax `@"..."'.  The default
     class name is `NXConstantString' if the GNU runtime is being used,
     and `NSConstantString' if the NeXT runtime is being used (see
     below).  The `-fconstant-cfstrings' option, if also present, will
     override the `-fconstant-string-class' setting and cause `@"..."'
     literals to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.

`-fgnu-runtime'
     Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU Objective-C
     runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.

`-fnext-runtime'
     Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the
     default for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac OS X.
     The macro `__NEXT_RUNTIME__' is predefined if (and only if) this
     option is used.

`-fno-nil-receivers'
     Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (e.g., `[receiver
     message:arg]') in this translation unit ensure that the receiver
     is not `nil'.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the
     runtime to be used.  Currently, this option is only available in
     conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.

`-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors'
     For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables
     is a C++ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so,
     synthesize a special `- (id) .cxx_construct' instance method that
     will run non-trivial default constructors on any such instance
     variables, in order, and then return `self'.  Similarly, check if
     any instance variable is a C++ object with a non-trivial
     destructor, and if so, synthesize a special `- (void)
     .cxx_destruct' method that will run all such default destructors,
     in reverse order.

     The `- (id) .cxx_construct' and/or `- (void) .cxx_destruct' methods
     thusly generated will only operate on instance variables declared
     in the current Objective-C class, and not those inherited from
     superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C runtime
     to invoke all such methods in an object's inheritance hierarchy.
     The `- (id) .cxx_construct' methods will be invoked by the runtime
     immediately after a new object instance is allocated; the `-
     (void) .cxx_destruct' methods will be invoked immediately before
     the runtime deallocates an object instance.

     As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4 and
     later has support for invoking the `- (id) .cxx_construct' and `-
     (void) .cxx_destruct' methods.

`-fobjc-direct-dispatch'
     Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is
     accomplished via the comm page.

`-fobjc-exceptions'
     Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in
     Objective-C, similar to what is offered by C++ and Java.  This
     option is unavailable in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac
     OS X 10.2 and earlier.

            @try {
              ...
                 @throw expr;
              ...
            }
            @catch (AnObjCClass *exc) {
              ...
                @throw expr;
              ...
                @throw;
              ...
            }
            @catch (AnotherClass *exc) {
              ...
            }
            @catch (id allOthers) {
              ...
            }
            @finally {
              ...
                @throw expr;
              ...
            }

     The `@throw' statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
     Objective-C++ program; when used inside of a `@catch' block, the
     `@throw' may appear without an argument (as shown above), in which
     case the object caught by the `@catch' will be rethrown.

     Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
     caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be
     caught by the nearest `@catch' clause capable of handling objects
     of that type, analogously to how `catch' blocks work in C++ and
     Java.  A `@catch(id ...)' clause (as shown above) may also be
     provided to catch any and all Objective-C exceptions not caught by
     previous `@catch' clauses (if any).

     The `@finally' clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from
     the immediately preceding `@try ... @catch' section.  This will
     happen regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or
     rethrown inside the `@try ... @catch' section, analogously to the
     behavior of the `finally' clause in Java.

     There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:

        * Although currently designed to be binary compatible with
          `NS_HANDLER'-style idioms provided by the `NSException'
          class, the new exceptions can only be used on Mac OS X 10.3
          (Panther) and later systems, due to additional functionality
          needed in the (NeXT) Objective-C runtime.

        * As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
          types other than Objective-C objects.   Furthermore, when
          used from Objective-C++, the Objective-C exception model does
          not interoperate with C++ exceptions at this time.  This
          means you cannot `@throw' an exception from Objective-C and
          `catch' it in C++, or vice versa (i.e., `throw ... @catch').

     The `-fobjc-exceptions' switch also enables the use of
     synchronization blocks for thread-safe execution:

            @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
              ...
            }

     Upon entering the `@synchronized' block, a thread of execution
     shall first check whether a lock has been placed on the
     corresponding `guard' object by another thread.  If it has, the
     current thread shall wait until the other thread relinquishes its
     lock.  Once `guard' becomes available, the current thread will
     place its own lock on it, execute the code contained in the
     `@synchronized' block, and finally relinquish the lock (thereby
     making `guard' available to other threads).

     Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be
     marked `@synchronized'.  Note that throwing exceptions out of
     `@synchronized' blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding
     object to be unlocked properly.

`-fobjc-gc'
     Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C and Objective-C++
     programs.

`-freplace-objc-classes'
     Emit a special marker instructing `ld(1)' not to statically link in
     the resulting object file, and allow `dyld(1)' to load it in at
     run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the
     Fix-and-Continue debugging mode, where the object file in question
     may be recompiled and dynamically reloaded in the course of
     program execution, without the need to restart the program itself.
     Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality is only available in
     conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.

`-fzero-link'
     When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily
     replaces calls to `objc_getClass("...")' (when the name of the
     class is known at compile time) with static class references that
     get initialized at load time, which improves run-time performance.
     Specifying the `-fzero-link' flag suppresses this behavior and
     causes calls to `objc_getClass("...")' to be retained.  This is
     useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows for individual
     class implementations to be modified during program execution.

`-gen-decls'
     Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source
     file to a file named `SOURCENAME.decl'.

`-Wassign-intercept (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the
     garbage collector.

`-Wno-protocol (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is
     issued for every method in the protocol that is not implemented by
     the class.  The default behavior is to issue a warning for every
     method not explicitly implemented in the class, even if a method
     implementation is inherited from the superclass.  If you use the
     `-Wno-protocol' option, then methods inherited from the superclass
     are considered to be implemented, and no warning is issued for
     them.

`-Wselector (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector
     are found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list
     of methods in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a
     check is performed for each selector appearing in a
     `@selector(...)'  expression, and a corresponding method for that
     selector has been found during compilation.  Because these checks
     scan the method table only at the end of compilation, these
     warnings are not produced if the final stage of compilation is not
     reached, for example because an error is found during compilation,
     or because the `-fsyntax-only' option is being used.

`-Wstrict-selector-match (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return
     types are found for a given selector when attempting to send a
     message using this selector to a receiver of type `id' or `Class'.
     When this flag is off (which is the default behavior), the
     compiler will omit such warnings if any differences found are
     confined to types which share the same size and alignment.

`-Wundeclared-selector (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn if a `@selector(...)' expression referring to an undeclared
     selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
     method with that name has been declared before the
     `@selector(...)' expression, either explicitly in an `@interface'
     or `@protocol' declaration, or implicitly in an `@implementation'
     section.  This option always performs its checks as soon as a
     `@selector(...)' expression is found, while `-Wselector' only
     performs its checks in the final stage of compilation.  This also
     enforces the coding style convention that methods and selectors
     must be declared before being used.

`-print-objc-runtime-info'
     Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed
     by value, if any.

3.7 Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting
=====================================================

Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  The options described
below can be used to control the diagnostic messages formatting
algorithm, e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Right now, only the C++ front end can
honor these options.  However it is expected, in the near future, that
the remaining front ends would be able to digest them correctly.

`-fmessage-length=N'
     Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about N
     characters.  The default is 72 characters for `g++' and 0 for the
     rest of the front ends supported by GCC.  If N is zero, then no
     line-wrapping will be done; each error message will appear on a
     single line.

`-fdiagnostics-show-location=once'
     Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
     messages reporter to emit _once_ source location information; that
     is, in case the message is too long to fit on a single physical
     line and has to be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted
     (as prefix) again, over and over, in subsequent continuation
     lines.  This is the default behavior.

`-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line'
     Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
     messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
     prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
     a message which is too long to fit on a single line.

`-fdiagnostics-show-option'
     This option instructs the diagnostic machinery to add text to each
     diagnostic emitted, which indicates which command line option
     directly controls that diagnostic, when such an option is known to
     the diagnostic machinery.

`-Wcoverage-mismatch'
     Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the
     `-fprofile-use' option.  If a source file was changed between
     `-fprofile-gen' and `-fprofile-use', the files with the profile
     feedback can fail to match the source file and GCC can not use the
     profile feedback information.  By default, GCC emits an error
     message in this case.  The option `-Wcoverage-mismatch' emits a
     warning instead of an error.  GCC does not use appropriate
     feedback profiles, so using this option can result in poorly
     optimized code.  This option is useful only in the case of very
     minor changes such as bug fixes to an existing code-base.

3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings
===========================================

Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which are
not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there may have
been an error.

 The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.

`-fsyntax-only'
     Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond
     that.

`-w'
     Inhibit all warning messages.

`-Werror'
     Make all warnings into errors.

`-Werror='
     Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a
     warning is appended, for example `-Werror=switch' turns the
     warnings controlled by `-Wswitch' into errors.  This switch takes a
     negative form, to be used to negate `-Werror' for specific
     warnings, for example `-Wno-error=switch' makes `-Wswitch'
     warnings not be errors, even when `-Werror' is in effect.  You can
     use the `-fdiagnostics-show-option' option to have each
     controllable warning amended with the option which controls it, to
     determine what to use with this option.

     Note that specifying `-Werror='FOO automatically implies `-W'FOO.
     However, `-Wno-error='FOO does not imply anything.

`-Wfatal-errors'
     This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first
     error occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing
     further error messages.


 You can request many specific warnings with options beginning `-W',
for example `-Wimplicit' to request warnings on implicit declarations.
Each of these specific warning options also has a negative form
beginning `-Wno-' to turn off warnings; for example, `-Wno-implicit'.
This manual lists only one of the two forms, whichever is not the
default.  For further, language-specific options also refer to *note
C++ Dialect Options:: and *note Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect
Options::.

`-pedantic'
     Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
     reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
     programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows
     the version of the ISO C standard specified by any `-std' option
     used.

     Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or
     without this option (though a rare few will require `-ansi' or a
     `-std' option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
     without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and
     C++ features are supported as well.  With this option, they are
     rejected.

     `-pedantic' does not cause warning messages for use of the
     alternate keywords whose names begin and end with `__'.  Pedantic
     warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
     `__extension__'.  However, only system header files should use
     these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
     *Note Alternate Keywords::.

     Some users try to use `-pedantic' to check programs for strict ISO
     C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they
     want: it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all--only those for
     which ISO C _requires_ a diagnostic, and some others for which
     diagnostics have been added.

     A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be
     useful in some instances, but would require considerable
     additional work and would be quite different from `-pedantic'.  We
     don't have plans to support such a feature in the near future.

     Where the standard specified with `-std' represents a GNU extended
     dialect of C, such as `gnu90' or `gnu99', there is a corresponding
     "base standard", the version of ISO C on which the GNU extended
     dialect is based.  Warnings from `-pedantic' are given where they
     are required by the base standard.  (It would not make sense for
     such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified
     GNU C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include
     all features the compiler supports with the given option, and
     there would be nothing to warn about.)

`-pedantic-errors'
     Like `-pedantic', except that errors are produced rather than
     warnings.

`-Wall'
     This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
     consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
     prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
     enables some language-specific warnings described in *note C++
     Dialect Options:: and *note Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect
     Options::.

     `-Wall' turns on the following warning flags:

          -Waddress
          -Warray-bounds (only with `-O2')
          -Wc++0x-compat
          -Wchar-subscripts
          -Wenum-compare (in C/Objc; this is on by default in C++)
          -Wimplicit-int
          -Wimplicit-function-declaration
          -Wcomment
          -Wformat
          -Wmain (only for C/ObjC and unless `-ffreestanding')
          -Wmissing-braces
          -Wnonnull
          -Wparentheses
          -Wpointer-sign
          -Wreorder
          -Wreturn-type
          -Wsequence-point
          -Wsign-compare (only in C++)
          -Wstrict-aliasing
          -Wstrict-overflow=1
          -Wswitch
          -Wtrigraphs
          -Wuninitialized
          -Wunknown-pragmas
          -Wunused-function
          -Wunused-label
          -Wunused-value
          -Wunused-variable
          -Wvolatile-register-var

     Note that some warning flags are not implied by `-Wall'.  Some of
     them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
     questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
     others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to
     avoid in some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code
     to suppress the warning. Some of them are enabled by `-Wextra' but
     many of them must be enabled individually.

`-Wextra'
     This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by
     `-Wall'. (This option used to be called `-W'.  The older name is
     still supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)

          -Wclobbered
          -Wempty-body
          -Wignored-qualifiers
          -Wmissing-field-initializers
          -Wmissing-parameter-type (C only)
          -Wold-style-declaration (C only)
          -Woverride-init
          -Wsign-compare
          -Wtype-limits
          -Wuninitialized
          -Wunused-parameter (only with `-Wunused' or `-Wall')

     The option `-Wextra' also prints warning messages for the
     following cases:

        * A pointer is compared against integer zero with `<', `<=',
          `>', or `>='.

        * (C++ only) An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a

        * (C++ only) Ambiguous virtual bases.

        * (C++ only) Subscripting an array which has been declared
          `register'.

        * (C++ only) Taking the address of a variable which has been
          declared `register'.

        * (C++ only) A base class is not initialized in a derived
          class' copy constructor.


`-Wchar-subscripts'
     Warn if an array subscript has type `char'.  This is a common cause
     of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on
     some machines.  This warning is enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wcomment'
     Warn whenever a comment-start sequence `/*' appears in a `/*'
     comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a `//' comment.
     This warning is enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wformat'
     Check calls to `printf' and `scanf', etc., to make sure that the
     arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
     specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string
     make sense.  This includes standard functions, and others
     specified by format attributes (*note Function Attributes::), in
     the `printf', `scanf', `strftime' and `strfmon' (an X/Open
     extension, not in the C standard) families (or other
     target-specific families).  Which functions are checked without
     format attributes having been specified depends on the standard
     version selected, and such checks of functions without the
     attribute specified are disabled by `-ffreestanding' or
     `-fno-builtin'.

     The formats are checked against the format features supported by
     GNU libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features,
     as well as features from the Single Unix Specification and some
     BSD and GNU extensions.  Other library implementations may not
     support all these features; GCC does not support warning about
     features that go beyond a particular library's limitations.
     However, if `-pedantic' is used with `-Wformat', warnings will be
     given about format features not in the selected standard version
     (but not for `strfmon' formats, since those are not in any version
     of the C standard).  *Note Options Controlling C Dialect: C
     Dialect Options.

     Since `-Wformat' also checks for null format arguments for several
     functions, `-Wformat' also implies `-Wnonnull'.

     `-Wformat' is included in `-Wall'.  For more control over some
     aspects of format checking, the options `-Wformat-y2k',
     `-Wno-format-extra-args', `-Wno-format-zero-length',
     `-Wformat-nonliteral', `-Wformat-security', and `-Wformat=2' are
     available, but are not included in `-Wall'.

`-Wformat-y2k'
     If `-Wformat' is specified, also warn about `strftime' formats
     which may yield only a two-digit year.

`-Wno-format-contains-nul'
     If `-Wformat' is specified, do not warn about format strings that
     contain NUL bytes.

`-Wno-format-extra-args'
     If `-Wformat' is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a
     `printf' or `scanf' format function.  The C standard specifies
     that such arguments are ignored.

     Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
     specified with `$' operand number specifications, normally
     warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know
     what type to pass to `va_arg' to skip the unused arguments.
     However, in the case of `scanf' formats, this option will suppress
     the warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the
     Single Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are
     allowed.

`-Wno-format-zero-length (C and Objective-C only)'
     If `-Wformat' is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.
     The C standard specifies that zero-length formats are allowed.

`-Wformat-nonliteral'
     If `-Wformat' is specified, also warn if the format string is not a
     string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the format function
     takes its format arguments as a `va_list'.

`-Wformat-security'
     If `-Wformat' is specified, also warn about uses of format
     functions that represent possible security problems.  At present,
     this warns about calls to `printf' and `scanf' functions where the
     format string is not a string literal and there are no format
     arguments, as in `printf (foo);'.  This may be a security hole if
     the format string came from untrusted input and contains `%n'.
     (This is currently a subset of what `-Wformat-nonliteral' warns
     about, but in future warnings may be added to `-Wformat-security'
     that are not included in `-Wformat-nonliteral'.)

`-Wformat=2'
     Enable `-Wformat' plus format checks not included in `-Wformat'.
     Currently equivalent to `-Wformat -Wformat-nonliteral
     -Wformat-security -Wformat-y2k'.

`-Wnonnull (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as
     requiring a non-null value by the `nonnull' function attribute.

     `-Wnonnull' is included in `-Wall' and `-Wformat'.  It can be
     disabled with the `-Wno-nonnull' option.

`-Winit-self (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn about uninitialized variables which are initialized with
     themselves.  Note this option can only be used with the
     `-Wuninitialized' option.

     For example, GCC will warn about `i' being uninitialized in the
     following snippet only when `-Winit-self' has been specified:
          int f()
          {
            int i = i;
            return i;
          }

`-Wimplicit-int (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn when a declaration does not specify a type.  This warning is
     enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wimplicit-function-declaration (C and Objective-C only)'
     Give a warning whenever a function is used before being declared.
     In C99 mode (`-std=c99' or `-std=gnu99'), this warning is enabled
     by default and it is made into an error by `-pedantic-errors'.
     This warning is also enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wimplicit'
     Same as `-Wimplicit-int' and `-Wimplicit-function-declaration'.
     This warning is enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wignored-qualifiers (C and C++ only)'
     Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier such as
     `const'.  For ISO C such a type qualifier has no effect, since the
     value returned by a function is not an lvalue.  For C++, the
     warning is only emitted for scalar types or `void'.  ISO C
     prohibits qualified `void' return types on function definitions,
     so such return types always receive a warning even without this
     option.

     This warning is also enabled by `-Wextra'.

`-Wmain'
     Warn if the type of `main' is suspicious.  `main' should be a
     function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
     arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.  This
     warning is enabled by default in C++ and is enabled by either
     `-Wall' or `-pedantic'.

`-Wmissing-braces'
     Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.
     In the following example, the initializer for `a' is not fully
     bracketed, but that for `b' is fully bracketed.

          int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
          int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };

     This warning is enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wmissing-include-dirs (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.

`-Wparentheses'
     Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as when
     there is an assignment in a context where a truth value is
     expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
     often get confused about.

     Also warn if a comparison like `x<=y<=z' appears; this is
     equivalent to `(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z', which is a different
     interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.

     Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
     `if' statement an `else' branch belongs.  Here is an example of
     such a case:

          {
            if (a)
              if (b)
                foo ();
            else
              bar ();
          }

     In C/C++, every `else' branch belongs to the innermost possible
     `if' statement, which in this example is `if (b)'.  This is often
     not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
     example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
     potential for this confusion, GCC will issue a warning when this
     flag is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces
     around the innermost `if' statement so there is no way the `else'
     could belong to the enclosing `if'.  The resulting code would look
     like this:

          {
            if (a)
              {
                if (b)
                  foo ();
                else
                  bar ();
              }
          }

     This warning is enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wsequence-point'
     Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of
     violations of sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.

     The C and C++ standards defines the order in which expressions in
     a C/C++ program are evaluated in terms of "sequence points", which
     represent a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the
     program: those executed before the sequence point, and those
     executed after it.  These occur after the evaluation of a full
     expression (one which is not part of a larger expression), after
     the evaluation of the first operand of a `&&', `||', `? :' or `,'
     (comma) operator, before a function is called (but after the
     evaluation of its arguments and the expression denoting the called
     function), and in certain other places.  Other than as expressed
     by the sequence point rules, the order of evaluation of
     subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All these rules
     describe only a partial order rather than a total order, since,
     for example, if two functions are called within one expression
     with no sequence point between them, the order in which the
     functions are called is not specified.  However, the standards
     committee have ruled that function calls do not overlap.

     It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to
     the values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior
     depends on this have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards
     specify that "Between the previous and next sequence point an
     object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the
     evaluation of an expression.  Furthermore, the prior value shall
     be read only to determine the value to be stored.".  If a program
     breaks these rules, the results on any particular implementation
     are entirely unpredictable.

     Examples of code with undefined behavior are `a = a++;', `a[n] =
     b[n++]' and `a[i++] = i;'.  Some more complicated cases are not
     diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false
     positive result, but in general it has been found fairly effective
     at detecting this sort of problem in programs.

     The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
     over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle
     cases.  Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed
     formal definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at
     `http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html'.

     This warning is enabled by `-Wall' for C and C++.

`-Wreturn-type'
     Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that
     defaults to `int'.  Also warn about any `return' statement with no
     return-value in a function whose return-type is not `void'
     (falling off the end of the function body is considered returning
     without a value), and about a `return' statement with an
     expression in a function whose return-type is `void'.

     For C++, a function without return type always produces a
     diagnostic message, even when `-Wno-return-type' is specified.
     The only exceptions are `main' and functions defined in system
     headers.

     This warning is enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wswitch'
     Warn whenever a `switch' statement has an index of enumerated type
     and lacks a `case' for one or more of the named codes of that
     enumeration.  (The presence of a `default' label prevents this
     warning.)  `case' labels outside the enumeration range also
     provoke warnings when this option is used (even if there is a
     `default' label).  This warning is enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wswitch-default'
     Warn whenever a `switch' statement does not have a `default' case.

`-Wswitch-enum'
     Warn whenever a `switch' statement has an index of enumerated type
     and lacks a `case' for one or more of the named codes of that
     enumeration.  `case' labels outside the enumeration range also
     provoke warnings when this option is used.  The only difference
     between `-Wswitch' and this option is that this option gives a
     warning about an omitted enumeration code even if there is a
     `default' label.

`-Wsync-nand (C and C++ only)'
     Warn when `__sync_fetch_and_nand' and `__sync_nand_and_fetch'
     built-in functions are used.  These functions changed semantics in
     GCC 4.4.

`-Wtrigraphs'
     Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the
     meaning of the program (trigraphs within comments are not warned
     about).  This warning is enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wunused-function'
     Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or a
     non-inline static function is unused.  This warning is enabled by
     `-Wall'.

`-Wunused-label'
     Warn whenever a label is declared but not used.  This warning is
     enabled by `-Wall'.

     To suppress this warning use the `unused' attribute (*note
     Variable Attributes::).

`-Wunused-parameter'
     Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its
     declaration.

     To suppress this warning use the `unused' attribute (*note
     Variable Attributes::).

`-Wno-unused-result'
     Do not warn if a caller of a function marked with attribute
     `warn_unused_result' (*note Variable Attributes::) does not use
     its return value. The default is `-Wunused-result'.

`-Wunused-variable'
     Warn whenever a local variable or non-constant static variable is
     unused aside from its declaration.  This warning is enabled by
     `-Wall'.

     To suppress this warning use the `unused' attribute (*note
     Variable Attributes::).

`-Wunused-value'
     Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not
     used. To suppress this warning cast the unused expression to
     `void'. This includes an expression-statement or the left-hand
     side of a comma expression that contains no side effects. For
     example, an expression such as `x[i,j]' will cause a warning, while
     `x[(void)i,j]' will not.

     This warning is enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wunused'
     All the above `-Wunused' options combined.

     In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you
     must either specify `-Wextra -Wunused' (note that `-Wall' implies
     `-Wunused'), or separately specify `-Wunused-parameter'.

`-Wuninitialized'
     Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being
     initialized or if a variable may be clobbered by a `setjmp' call.
     In C++, warn if a non-static reference or non-static `const' member
     appears in a class without constructors.

     If you want to warn about code which uses the uninitialized value
     of the variable in its own initializer, use the `-Winit-self'
     option.

     These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
     elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
     variables which are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
     not occur for variables or elements declared `volatile'.  Because
     these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or
     elements for which there are warnings will depend on the precise
     optimization options and version of GCC used.

     Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used
     only to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
     computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the
     warnings are printed.

     These warnings are made optional because GCC is not smart enough
     to see all the reasons why the code might be correct despite
     appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how this can
     happen:

          {
            int x;
            switch (y)
              {
              case 1: x = 1;
                break;
              case 2: x = 4;
                break;
              case 3: x = 5;
              }
            foo (x);
          }

     If the value of `y' is always 1, 2 or 3, then `x' is always
     initialized, but GCC doesn't know this.  Here is another common
     case:

          {
            int save_y;
            if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
            ...
            if (change_y) y = save_y;
          }

     This has no bug because `save_y' is used only if it is set.

     This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable
     might be changed by a call to `longjmp'.  These warnings as well
     are possible only in optimizing compilation.

     The compiler sees only the calls to `setjmp'.  It cannot know
     where `longjmp' will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
     call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a
     warning even when there is in fact no problem because `longjmp'
     cannot in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.

     Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the
     functions you use that never return as `noreturn'.  *Note Function
     Attributes::.

     This warning is enabled by `-Wall' or `-Wextra'.

`-Wunknown-pragmas'
     Warn when a #pragma directive is encountered which is not
     understood by GCC.  If this command line option is used, warnings
     will even be issued for unknown pragmas in system header files.
     This is not the case if the warnings were only enabled by the
     `-Wall' command line option.

`-Wno-pragmas'
     Do not warn about misuses of pragmas, such as incorrect parameters,
     invalid syntax, or conflicts between pragmas.  See also
     `-Wunknown-pragmas'.

`-Wstrict-aliasing'
     This option is only active when `-fstrict-aliasing' is active.  It
     warns about code which might break the strict aliasing rules that
     the compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does not
     catch all cases, but does attempt to catch the more common
     pitfalls.  It is included in `-Wall'.  It is equivalent to
     `-Wstrict-aliasing=3'

`-Wstrict-aliasing=n'
     This option is only active when `-fstrict-aliasing' is active.  It
     warns about code which might break the strict aliasing rules that
     the compiler is using for optimization.  Higher levels correspond
     to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).  Higher levels also
     correspond to more effort, similar to the way -O works.
     `-Wstrict-aliasing' is equivalent to `-Wstrict-aliasing=n', with
     n=3.

     Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.  Possibly useful
     when higher levels do not warn but -fstrict-aliasing still breaks
     the code, as it has very few false negatives.  However, it has
     many false positives.  Warns for all pointer conversions between
     possibly incompatible types, even if never dereferenced.  Runs in
     the frontend only.

     Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.  May still have many
     false positives (not as many as level 1 though), and few false
     negatives (but possibly more than level 1).  Unlike level 1, it
     only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about incomplete
     types.  Runs in the frontend only.

     Level 3 (default for `-Wstrict-aliasing'): Should have very few
     false positives and few false negatives.  Slightly slower than
     levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.  Takes care of the
     common pun+dereference pattern in the frontend:
     `*(int*)&some_float'.  If optimization is enabled, it also runs in
     the backend, where it deals with multiple statement cases using
     flow-sensitive points-to information.  Only warns when the
     converted pointer is dereferenced.  Does not warn about incomplete
     types.

`-Wstrict-overflow'
`-Wstrict-overflow=N'
     This option is only active when `-fstrict-overflow' is active.  It
     warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
     assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does
     not warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only
     warns about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.
     Thus this warning depends on the optimization level.

     An optimization which assumes that signed overflow does not occur
     is perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such
     that overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning
     can easily give a false positive: a warning about code which is not
     actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
     warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
     undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a
     loop will require, in particular when determining whether a loop
     will be executed at all.

    `-Wstrict-overflow=1'
          Warn about cases which are both questionable and easy to
          avoid.  For example: `x + 1 > x'; with `-fstrict-overflow',
          the compiler will simplify this to `1'.  This level of
          `-Wstrict-overflow' is enabled by `-Wall'; higher levels are
          not, and must be explicitly requested.

    `-Wstrict-overflow=2'
          Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified
          to a constant.  For example: `abs (x) >= 0'.  This can only be
          simplified when `-fstrict-overflow' is in effect, because
          `abs (INT_MIN)' overflows to `INT_MIN', which is less than
          zero.  `-Wstrict-overflow' (with no level) is the same as
          `-Wstrict-overflow=2'.

    `-Wstrict-overflow=3'
          Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.
          For example: `x + 1 > 1' will be simplified to `x > 0'.

    `-Wstrict-overflow=4'
          Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the
          above cases.  For example: `(x * 10) / 5' will be simplified
          to `x * 2'.

    `-Wstrict-overflow=5'
          Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the
          magnitude of a constant involved in a comparison.  For
          example: `x + 2 > y' will be simplified to `x + 1 >= y'.
          This is reported only at the highest warning level because
          this simplification applies to many comparisons, so this
          warning level will give a very large number of false
          positives.

`-Warray-bounds'
     This option is only active when `-ftree-vrp' is active (default
     for -O2 and above). It warns about subscripts to arrays that are
     always out of bounds. This warning is enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wno-div-by-zero'
     Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.  Floating
     point division by zero is not warned about, as it can be a
     legitimate way of obtaining infinities and NaNs.

`-Wsystem-headers'
     Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
     Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the
     assumption that they usually do not indicate real problems and
     would only make the compiler output harder to read.  Using this
     command line option tells GCC to emit warnings from system headers
     as if they occurred in user code.  However, note that using
     `-Wall' in conjunction with this option will _not_ warn about
     unknown pragmas in system headers--for that, `-Wunknown-pragmas'
     must also be used.

`-Wfloat-equal'
     Warn if floating point values are used in equality comparisons.

     The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
     programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
     infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you
     need to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the
     maximum or likely maximum error that the computation introduces,
     and allow for it when performing comparisons (and when producing
     output, but that's a different problem).  In particular, instead
     of testing for equality, you would check to see whether the two
     values have ranges that overlap; and this is done with the
     relational operators, so equality comparisons are probably
     mistaken.

`-Wtraditional (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
     traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have
     no traditional C equivalent, and/or problematic constructs which
     should be avoided.

        * Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the
          macro body.  In traditional C macro replacement takes place
          within string literals, but does not in ISO C.

        * In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
          Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a
          directive if the `#' appeared in column 1 on the line.
          Therefore `-Wtraditional' warns about directives that
          traditional C understands but would ignore because the `#'
          does not appear as the first character on the line.  It also
          suggests you hide directives like `#pragma' not understood by
          traditional C by indenting them.  Some traditional
          implementations would not recognize `#elif', so it suggests
          avoiding it altogether.

        * A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

        * The unary plus operator.

        * The `U' integer constant suffix, or the `F' or `L' floating
          point constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the `L'
          suffix on integer constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in
          macros defined in the system headers of most modern systems,
          e.g. the `_MIN'/`_MAX' macros in `<limits.h>'.  Use of these
          macros in user code might normally lead to spurious warnings,
          however GCC's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
          avoid warning in these cases.

        * A function declared external in one block and then used after
          the end of the block.

        * A `switch' statement has an operand of type `long'.

        * A non-`static' function declaration follows a `static' one.
          This construct is not accepted by some traditional C
          compilers.

        * The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
          signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only
          issued if the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal
          or octal values, which typically represent bit patterns, are
          not warned about.

        * Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

        * Initialization of automatic aggregates.

        * Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a
          separate namespace for labels.

        * Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the
          warning is omitted.  This is done under the assumption that
          the zero initializer in user code appears conditioned on e.g.
          `__STDC__' to avoid missing initializer warnings and relies
          on default initialization to zero in the traditional C case.

        * Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating point values
          and vice versa.  The absence of these prototypes when
          compiling with traditional C would cause serious problems.
          This is a subset of the possible conversion warnings, for the
          full set use `-Wtraditional-conversion'.

        * Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning
          intentionally is _not_ issued for prototype declarations or
          variadic functions because these ISO C features will appear
          in your code when using libiberty's traditional C
          compatibility macros, `PARAMS' and `VPARAMS'.  This warning
          is also bypassed for nested functions because that feature is
          already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to traditional
          C compatibility.

`-Wtraditional-conversion (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different
     from what would happen to the same argument in the absence of a
     prototype.  This includes conversions of fixed point to floating
     and vice versa, and conversions changing the width or signedness
     of a fixed point argument except when the same as the default
     promotion.

`-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.
     This construct, known from C++, was introduced with ISO C99 and is
     by default allowed in GCC.  It is not supported by ISO C90 and was
     not supported by GCC versions before GCC 3.0.  *Note Mixed
     Declarations::.

`-Wundef'
     Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an `#if' directive.

`-Wno-endif-labels'
     Do not warn whenever an `#else' or an `#endif' are followed by
     text.

`-Wshadow'
     Warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable,
     parameter or global variable or whenever a built-in function is
     shadowed.

`-Wlarger-than=LEN'
     Warn whenever an object of larger than LEN bytes is defined.

`-Wframe-larger-than=LEN'
     Warn if the size of a function frame is larger than LEN bytes.
     The computation done to determine the stack frame size is
     approximate and not conservative.  The actual requirements may be
     somewhat greater than LEN even if you do not get a warning.  In
     addition, any space allocated via `alloca', variable-length
     arrays, or related constructs is not included by the compiler when
     determining whether or not to issue a warning.

`-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations'
     Warn if the loop cannot be optimized because the compiler could not
     assume anything on the bounds of the loop indices.  With
     `-funsafe-loop-optimizations' warn if the compiler made such
     assumptions.

`-Wno-pedantic-ms-format (MinGW targets only)'
     Disables the warnings about non-ISO `printf' / `scanf' format
     width specifiers `I32', `I64', and `I' used on Windows targets
     depending on the MS runtime, when you are using the options
     `-Wformat' and `-pedantic' without gnu-extensions.

`-Wpointer-arith'
     Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a function type
     or of `void'.  GNU C assigns these types a size of 1, for
     convenience in calculations with `void *' pointers and pointers to
     functions.  In C++, warn also when an arithmetic operation involves
     `NULL'.  This warning is also enabled by `-pedantic'.

`-Wtype-limits'
     Warn if a comparison is always true or always false due to the
     limited range of the data type, but do not warn for constant
     expressions.  For example, warn if an unsigned variable is
     compared against zero with `<' or `>='.  This warning is also
     enabled by `-Wextra'.

`-Wbad-function-cast (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type.  For
     example, warn if `int malloc()' is cast to `anything *'.

`-Wc++-compat (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn about ISO C constructs that are outside of the common subset
     of ISO C and ISO C++, e.g. request for implicit conversion from
     `void *' to a pointer to non-`void' type.

`-Wc++0x-compat (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO C++
     1998 and ISO C++ 200x, e.g., identifiers in ISO C++ 1998 that will
     become keywords in ISO C++ 200x.  This warning is enabled by
     `-Wall'.

`-Wcast-qual'
     Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier
     from the target type.  For example, warn if a `const char *' is
     cast to an ordinary `char *'.

     Also warn when making a cast which introduces a type qualifier in
     an unsafe way.  For example, casting `char **' to `const char **'
     is unsafe, as in this example:

            /* p is char ** value.  */
            const char **q = (const char **) p;
            /* Assignment of readonly string to const char * is OK.  */
            *q = "string";
            /* Now char** pointer points to read-only memory.  */
            **p = 'b';

`-Wcast-align'
     Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment
     of the target is increased.  For example, warn if a `char *' is
     cast to an `int *' on machines where integers can only be accessed
     at two- or four-byte boundaries.

`-Wwrite-strings'
     When compiling C, give string constants the type `const
     char[LENGTH]' so that copying the address of one into a
     non-`const' `char *' pointer will get a warning.  These warnings
     will help you find at compile time code that can try to write into
     a string constant, but only if you have been very careful about
     using `const' in declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will
     just be a nuisance. This is why we did not make `-Wall' request
     these warnings.

     When compiling C++, warn about the deprecated conversion from
     string literals to `char *'.  This warning is enabled by default
     for C++ programs.

`-Wclobbered'
     Warn for variables that might be changed by `longjmp' or `vfork'.
     This warning is also enabled by `-Wextra'.

`-Wconversion'
     Warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value. This includes
     conversions between real and integer, like `abs (x)' when `x' is
     `double'; conversions between signed and unsigned, like `unsigned
     ui = -1'; and conversions to smaller types, like `sqrtf (M_PI)'.
     Do not warn for explicit casts like `abs ((int) x)' and `ui =
     (unsigned) -1', or if the value is not changed by the conversion
     like in `abs (2.0)'.  Warnings about conversions between signed
     and unsigned integers can be disabled by using
     `-Wno-sign-conversion'.

     For C++, also warn for confusing overload resolution for
     user-defined conversions; and conversions that will never use a
     type conversion operator: conversions to `void', the same type, a
     base class or a reference to them. Warnings about conversions
     between signed and unsigned integers are disabled by default in
     C++ unless `-Wsign-conversion' is explicitly enabled.

`-Wno-conversion-null (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Do not warn for conversions between `NULL' and non-pointer types.
     `-Wconversion-null' is enabled by default.

`-Wempty-body'
     Warn if an empty body occurs in an `if', `else' or `do while'
     statement.  This warning is also enabled by `-Wextra'.

`-Wenum-compare'
     Warn about a comparison between values of different enum types. In
     C++ this warning is enabled by default.  In C this warning is
     enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wjump-misses-init (C, Objective-C only)'
     Warn if a `goto' statement or a `switch' statement jumps forward
     across the initialization of a variable, or jumps backward to a
     label after the variable has been initialized.  This only warns
     about variables which are initialized when they are declared.
     This warning is only supported for C and Objective C; in C++ this
     sort of branch is an error in any case.

     `-Wjump-misses-init' is included in `-Wc++-compat'.  It can be
     disabled with the `-Wno-jump-misses-init' option.

`-Wsign-compare'
     Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could
     produce an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to
     unsigned.  This warning is also enabled by `-Wextra'; to get the
     other warnings of `-Wextra' without this warning, use `-Wextra
     -Wno-sign-compare'.

`-Wsign-conversion'
     Warn for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an
     integer value, like assigning a signed integer expression to an
     unsigned integer variable. An explicit cast silences the warning.
     In C, this option is enabled also by `-Wconversion'.

`-Waddress'
     Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include using
     the address of a function in a conditional expression, such as
     `void func(void); if (func)', and comparisons against the memory
     address of a string literal, such as `if (x == "abc")'.  Such uses
     typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
     always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
     indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
     call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified
     behavior and are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that
     the programmer intended to use `strcmp'.  This warning is enabled
     by `-Wall'.

`-Wlogical-op'
     Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in expressions.
     This includes using logical operators in contexts where a bit-wise
     operator is likely to be expected.

`-Waggregate-return'
     Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined
     or called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also
     elicits a warning.)

`-Wno-attributes'
     Do not warn if an unexpected `__attribute__' is used, such as
     unrecognized attributes, function attributes applied to variables,
     etc.  This will not stop errors for incorrect use of supported
     attributes.

`-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined'
     Do not warn if certain built-in macros are redefined.  This
     suppresses warnings for redefinition of `__TIMESTAMP__',
     `__TIME__', `__DATE__', `__FILE__', and `__BASE_FILE__'.

`-Wstrict-prototypes (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
     argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted
     without a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies the
     argument types.)

`-Wold-style-declaration (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in a
     declaration. For example, warn if storage-class specifiers like
     `static' are not the first things in a declaration.  This warning
     is also enabled by `-Wextra'.

`-Wold-style-definition (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is
     given even if there is a previous prototype.

`-Wmissing-parameter-type (C and Objective-C only)'
     A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in
     K&R-style functions:

          void foo(bar) { }

     This warning is also enabled by `-Wextra'.

`-Wmissing-prototypes (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
     declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
     provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that
     fail to be declared in header files.

`-Wmissing-declarations'
     Warn if a global function is defined without a previous
     declaration.  Do so even if the definition itself provides a
     prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions that are
     not declared in header files.  In C++, no warnings are issued for
     function templates, or for inline functions, or for functions in
     anonymous namespaces.

`-Wmissing-field-initializers'
     Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For
     example, the following code would cause such a warning, because
     `x.h' is implicitly zero:

          struct s { int f, g, h; };
          struct s x = { 3, 4 };

     This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the
     following modification would not trigger a warning:

          struct s { int f, g, h; };
          struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };

     This warning is included in `-Wextra'.  To get other `-Wextra'
     warnings without this one, use `-Wextra
     -Wno-missing-field-initializers'.

`-Wmissing-noreturn'
     Warn about functions which might be candidates for attribute
     `noreturn'.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute
     ones.  Care should be taken to manually verify functions actually
     do not ever return before adding the `noreturn' attribute,
     otherwise subtle code generation bugs could be introduced.  You
     will not get a warning for `main' in hosted C environments.

`-Wmissing-format-attribute'
     Warn about function pointers which might be candidates for `format'
     attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute
     ones.  GCC will guess that function pointers with `format'
     attributes that are used in assignment, initialization, parameter
     passing or return statements should have a corresponding `format'
     attribute in the resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the
     assignment or initialization, the type of the parameter variable,
     or the return type of the containing function respectively should
     also have a `format' attribute to avoid the warning.

     GCC will also warn about function definitions which might be
     candidates for `format' attributes.  Again, these are only
     possible candidates.  GCC will guess that `format' attributes
     might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like
     `vprintf' or `vscanf', but this might not always be the case, and
     some functions for which `format' attributes are appropriate may
     not be detected.

`-Wno-multichar'
     Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (`'FOOF'') is used.
     Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
     implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable
     code.

`-Wnormalized=<none|id|nfc|nfkc>'
     In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are
     different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when
     characters outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can
     have two different character sequences that look the same.  To
     avoid confusion, the ISO 10646 standard sets out some
     "normalization rules" which when applied ensure that two sequences
     that look the same are turned into the same sequence.  GCC can
     warn you if you are using identifiers which have not been
     normalized; this option controls that warning.

     There are four levels of warning that GCC supports.  The default is
     `-Wnormalized=nfc', which warns about any identifier which is not
     in the ISO 10646 "C" normalized form, "NFC".  NFC is the
     recommended form for most uses.

     Unfortunately, there are some characters which ISO C and ISO C++
     allow in identifiers that when turned into NFC aren't allowable as
     identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in
     portable ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC.
     `-Wnormalized=id' suppresses the warning for these characters.  It
     is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will
     correct this, which is why this option is not the default.

     You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
     `-Wnormalized=none'.  You would only want to do this if you were
     using some other normalization scheme (like "D"), because
     otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible
     to see.

     Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look
     identical in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once
     formatting has been applied.  For instance `\u207F', "SUPERSCRIPT
     LATIN SMALL LETTER N", will display just like a regular `n' which
     has been placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the "NFKC"
     normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
     well, and GCC will warn if your code is not in NFKC if you use
     `-Wnormalized=nfkc'.  This warning is comparable to warning about
     every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
     confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
     useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment
     is unable to be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

`-Wno-deprecated'
     Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.  *Note Deprecated
     Features::.

`-Wno-deprecated-declarations'
     Do not warn about uses of functions (*note Function Attributes::),
     variables (*note Variable Attributes::), and types (*note Type
     Attributes::) marked as deprecated by using the `deprecated'
     attribute.

`-Wno-overflow'
     Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant expressions.

`-Woverride-init (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn if an initialized field without side effects is overridden
     when using designated initializers (*note Designated Initializers:
     Designated Inits.).

     This warning is included in `-Wextra'.  To get other `-Wextra'
     warnings without this one, use `-Wextra -Wno-override-init'.

`-Wpacked'
     Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
     attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
     Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
     instance, in this code, the variable `f.x' in `struct bar' will be
     misaligned even though `struct bar' does not itself have the
     packed attribute:

          struct foo {
            int x;
            char a, b, c, d;
          } __attribute__((packed));
          struct bar {
            char z;
            struct foo f;
          };

`-Wpacked-bitfield-compat'
     The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the `packed' attribute
     on bit-fields of type `char'.  This has been fixed in GCC 4.4 but
     the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  GCC
     informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in GCC 4.4.
     For example there is no longer a 4-bit padding between field `a'
     and `b' in this structure:

          struct foo
          {
            char a:4;
            char b:8;
          } __attribute__ ((packed));

     This warning is enabled by default.  Use
     `-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat' to disable this warning.

`-Wpadded'
     Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an
     element of the structure or to align the whole structure.
     Sometimes when this happens it is possible to rearrange the fields
     of the structure to reduce the padding and so make the structure
     smaller.

`-Wredundant-decls'
     Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope,
     even in cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes
     nothing.

`-Wnested-externs (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn if an `extern' declaration is encountered within a function.

`-Winline'
     Warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as
     inline.  Even with this option, the compiler will not warn about
     failures to inline functions declared in system headers.

     The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or
     not to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into
     account the size of the function being inlined and the amount of
     inlining that has already been done in the current function.
     Therefore, seemingly insignificant changes in the source program
     can cause the warnings produced by `-Winline' to appear or
     disappear.

`-Wno-invalid-offsetof (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Suppress warnings from applying the `offsetof' macro to a non-POD
     type.  According to the 1998 ISO C++ standard, applying `offsetof'
     to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing C++ implementations,
     however, `offsetof' typically gives meaningful results even when
     applied to certain kinds of non-POD types. (Such as a simple
     `struct' that fails to be a POD type only by virtue of having a
     constructor.)  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
     writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to
     ignore the warning about it.

     The restrictions on `offsetof' may be relaxed in a future version
     of the C++ standard.

`-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast (C and Objective-C only)'
     Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a
     different size.

`-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast (C and Objective-C only)'
     Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a
     different size.

`-Winvalid-pch'
     Warn if a precompiled header (*note Precompiled Headers::) is
     found in the search path but can't be used.

`-Wlong-long'
     Warn if `long long' type is used.  This is enabled by either
     `-pedantic' or `-Wtraditional' in ISO C90 and C++98 modes.  To
     inhibit the warning messages, use `-Wno-long-long'.

`-Wvariadic-macros'
     Warn if variadic macros are used in pedantic ISO C90 mode, or the
     GNU alternate syntax when in pedantic ISO C99 mode.  This is
     default.  To inhibit the warning messages, use
     `-Wno-variadic-macros'.

`-Wvla'
     Warn if variable length array is used in the code.  `-Wno-vla'
     will prevent the `-pedantic' warning of the variable length array.

`-Wvolatile-register-var'
     Warn if a register variable is declared volatile.  The volatile
     modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that may eliminate
     reads and/or writes to register variables.  This warning is
     enabled by `-Wall'.

`-Wdisabled-optimization'
     Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning
     does not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your
     code; it merely indicates that GCC's optimizers were unable to
     handle the code effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code
     is too big or too complex; GCC will refuse to optimize programs
     when the optimization itself is likely to take inordinate amounts
     of time.

`-Wpointer-sign (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different
     signedness.  This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.
     It is implied by `-Wall' and by `-pedantic', which can be disabled
     with `-Wno-pointer-sign'.

`-Wstack-protector'
     This option is only active when `-fstack-protector' is active.  It
     warns about functions that will not be protected against stack
     smashing.

`-Wno-mudflap'
     Suppress warnings about constructs that cannot be instrumented by
     `-fmudflap'.

`-Woverlength-strings'
     Warn about string constants which are longer than the "minimum
     maximum" length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
     generally allow string constants which are much longer than the
     standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
     using longer strings.

     The limit applies _after_ string constant concatenation, and does
     not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters;
     in C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
     minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.

     This option is implied by `-pedantic', and can be disabled with
     `-Wno-overlength-strings'.

`-Wunsuffixed-float-constants (C and Objective-C only)'
     GCC will issue a warning for any floating constant that does not
     have a suffix.  When used together with `-Wsystem-headers' it will
     warn about such constants in system header files.  This can be
     useful when preparing code to use with the `FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64'
     pragma from the decimal floating-point extension to C99.

3.9 Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC
=============================================

GCC has various special options that are used for debugging either your
program or GCC:

`-g'
     Produce debugging information in the operating system's native
     format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2).  GDB can work with this
     debugging information.

     On most systems that use stabs format, `-g' enables use of extra
     debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
     makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other
     debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.  If you want to
     control for certain whether to generate the extra information, use
     `-gstabs+', `-gstabs', `-gxcoff+', `-gxcoff', or `-gvms' (see
     below).

     GCC allows you to use `-g' with `-O'.  The shortcuts taken by
     optimized code may occasionally produce surprising results: some
     variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of control may
     briefly move where you did not expect it; some statements may not
     be executed because they compute constant results or their values
     were already at hand; some statements may execute in different
     places because they were moved out of loops.

     Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This
     makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might
     have bugs.

     The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the
     capability for more than one debugging format.

`-ggdb'
     Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use
     the most expressive format available (DWARF 2, stabs, or the
     native format if neither of those are supported), including GDB
     extensions if at all possible.

`-gstabs'
     Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
     supported), without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by
     DBX on most BSD systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4
     systems this option produces stabs debugging output which is not
     understood by DBX or SDB.  On System V Release 4 systems this
     option requires the GNU assembler.

`-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols'
     Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
     supported), for only symbols that are actually used.

`-femit-class-debug-always'
     Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in only
     one object file, emit it in all object files using the class.
     This option should be used only with debuggers that are unable to
     handle the way GCC normally emits debugging information for
     classes because using this option will increase the size of
     debugging information by as much as a factor of two.

`-gstabs+'
     Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.

`-gcoff'
     Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by SDB on most System V
     systems prior to System V Release 4.

`-gxcoff'
     Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM
     RS/6000 systems.

`-gxcoff+'
     Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program, and may cause
     assemblers other than the GNU assembler (GAS) to fail with an
     error.

`-gdwarf-VERSION'
     Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by DBX on IRIX 6.  The value
     of VERSION may be either 2, 3 or 4; the default version is 2.

     Note that with DWARF version 2 some ports require, and will always
     use, some non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind tables.

     Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 and `-fvar-tracking-assignments' for
     maximum benefit.

`-gstrict-dwarf'
     Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than
     selected with `-gdwarf-VERSION'.  On most targets using
     non-conflicting DWARF extensions from later standard versions is
     allowed.

`-gno-strict-dwarf'
     Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than
     selected with `-gdwarf-VERSION'.

`-gvms'
     Produce debugging information in VMS debug format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by DEBUG on VMS systems.

`-gLEVEL'
`-ggdbLEVEL'
`-gstabsLEVEL'
`-gcoffLEVEL'
`-gxcoffLEVEL'
`-gvmsLEVEL'
     Request debugging information and also use LEVEL to specify how
     much information.  The default level is 2.

     Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, `-g0' negates
     `-g'.

     Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces
     in parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This
     includes descriptions of functions and external variables, but no
     information about local variables and no line numbers.

     Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro
     definitions present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro
     expansion when you use `-g3'.

     `-gdwarf-2' does not accept a concatenated debug level, because
     GCC used to support an option `-gdwarf' that meant to generate
     debug information in version 1 of the DWARF format (which is very
     different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.
     That debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be
     changed now.  Instead use an additional `-gLEVEL' option to change
     the debug level for DWARF.

`-gtoggle'
     Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option
     would have generated it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The
     position of this argument in the command line does not matter, it
     takes effect after all other options are processed, and it does so
     only once, no matter how many times it is given.  This is mainly
     intended to be used with `-fcompare-debug'.

`-fdump-final-insns[=FILE]'
     Dump the final internal representation (RTL) to FILE.  If the
     optional argument is omitted (or if FILE is `.'), the name of the
     dump file will be determined by appending `.gkd' to the
     compilation output file name.

`-fcompare-debug[=OPTS]'
     If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a second
     time, adding OPTS and `-fcompare-debug-second' to the arguments
     passed to the second compilation.  Dump the final internal
     representation in both compilations, and print an error if they
     differ.

     If the equal sign is omitted, the default `-gtoggle' is used.

     The environment variable `GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG', if defined, non-empty
     and nonzero, implicitly enables `-fcompare-debug'.  If
     `GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG' is defined to a string starting with a dash,
     then it is used for OPTS, otherwise the default `-gtoggle' is used.

     `-fcompare-debug=', with the equal sign but without OPTS, is
     equivalent to `-fno-compare-debug', which disables the dumping of
     the final representation and the second compilation, preventing
     even `GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG' from taking effect.

     To verify full coverage during `-fcompare-debug' testing, set
     `GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG' to say `-fcompare-debug-not-overridden', which
     GCC will reject as an invalid option in any actual compilation
     (rather than preprocessing, assembly or linking).  To get just a
     warning, setting `GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG' to `-w%n-fcompare-debug not
     overridden' will do.

`-fcompare-debug-second'
     This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the second
     compilation requested by `-fcompare-debug', along with options to
     silence warnings, and omitting other options that would cause
     side-effect compiler outputs to files or to the standard output.
     Dump files and preserved temporary files are renamed so as to
     contain the `.gk' additional extension during the second
     compilation, to avoid overwriting those generated by the first.

     When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes the
     _first_ compilation to be skipped, which makes it useful for little
     other than debugging the compiler proper.

`-feliminate-dwarf2-dups'
     Compress DWARF2 debugging information by eliminating duplicated
     information about each symbol.  This option only makes sense when
     generating DWARF2 debugging information with `-gdwarf-2'.

`-femit-struct-debug-baseonly'
     Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the base
     name of the compilation source file matches the base name of file
     in which the struct was defined.

     This option substantially reduces the size of debugging
     information, but at significant potential loss in type information
     to the debugger.  See `-femit-struct-debug-reduced' for a less
     aggressive option.  See `-femit-struct-debug-detailed' for more
     detailed control.

     This option works only with DWARF 2.

`-femit-struct-debug-reduced'
     Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the base
     name of the compilation source file matches the base name of file
     in which the type was defined, unless the struct is a template or
     defined in a system header.

     This option significantly reduces the size of debugging
     information, with some potential loss in type information to the
     debugger.  See `-femit-struct-debug-baseonly' for a more
     aggressive option.  See `-femit-struct-debug-detailed' for more
     detailed control.

     This option works only with DWARF 2.

`-femit-struct-debug-detailed[=SPEC-LIST]'
     Specify the struct-like types for which the compiler will generate
     debug information.  The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug
     information between different object files within the same program.

     This option is a detailed version of `-femit-struct-debug-reduced'
     and `-femit-struct-debug-baseonly', which will serve for most
     needs.

     A specification has the syntax
     [`dir:'|`ind:'][`ord:'|`gen:'](`any'|`sys'|`base'|`none')

     The optional first word limits the specification to structs that
     are used directly (`dir:') or used indirectly (`ind:').  A struct
     type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member.
     Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs.  That is, when
     use of an incomplete struct would be legal, the use is indirect.
     An example is `struct one direct; struct two * indirect;'.

     The optional second word limits the specification to ordinary
     structs (`ord:') or generic structs (`gen:').  Generic structs are
     a bit complicated to explain.  For C++, these are non-explicit
     specializations of template classes, or non-template classes
     within the above.  Other programming languages have generics, but
     `-femit-struct-debug-detailed' does not yet implement them.

     The third word specifies the source files for those structs for
     which the compiler will emit debug information.  The values `none'
     and `any' have the normal meaning.  The value `base' means that
     the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears
     must match the base of the name of the main compilation file.  In
     practice, this means that types declared in `foo.c' and `foo.h'
     will have debug information, but types declared in other header
     will not.  The value `sys' means those types satisfying `base' or
     declared in system or compiler headers.

     You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your
     application.

     The default is `-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all'.

     This option works only with DWARF 2.

`-fenable-icf-debug'
     Generate additional debug information to support identical code
     folding (ICF).  This option only works with DWARF version 2 or
     higher.

`-fno-merge-debug-strings'
     Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the debugging
     information which are identical in different object files.
     Merging is not supported by all assemblers or linkers.  Merging
     decreases the size of the debug information in the output file at
     the cost of increasing link processing time.  Merging is enabled
     by default.

`-fdebug-prefix-map=OLD=NEW'
     When compiling files in directory `OLD', record debugging
     information describing them as in `NEW' instead.

`-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm'
     Emit DWARF 2 unwind info as compiler generated `.eh_frame' section
     instead of using GAS `.cfi_*' directives.

`-p'
     Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
     analysis program `prof'.  You must use this option when compiling
     the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
     linking.

`-pg'
     Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
     analysis program `gprof'.  You must use this option when compiling
     the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
     linking.

`-Q'
     Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled,
     and print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.

`-ftime-report'
     Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time consumed
     by each pass when it finishes.

`-fmem-report'
     Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
     allocation when it finishes.

`-fpre-ipa-mem-report'

`-fpost-ipa-mem-report'
     Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
     allocation before or after interprocedural optimization.

`-fprofile-arcs'
     Add code so that program flow "arcs" are instrumented.  During
     execution the program records how many times each branch and call
     is executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the
     compiled program exits it saves this data to a file called
     `AUXNAME.gcda' for each source file.  The data may be used for
     profile-directed optimizations (`-fbranch-probabilities'), or for
     test coverage analysis (`-ftest-coverage').  Each object file's
     AUXNAME is generated from the name of the output file, if
     explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise
     it is the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix
     is removed (e.g. `foo.gcda' for input file `dir/foo.c', or
     `dir/foo.gcda' for output file specified as `-o dir/foo.o').
     *Note Cross-profiling::.

`--coverage'
     This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for
     coverage analysis.  The option is a synonym for `-fprofile-arcs'
     `-ftest-coverage' (when compiling) and `-lgcov' (when linking).
     See the documentation for those options for more details.

        * Compile the source files with `-fprofile-arcs' plus
          optimization and code generation options.  For test coverage
          analysis, use the additional `-ftest-coverage' option.  You
          do not need to profile every source file in a program.

        * Link your object files with `-lgcov' or `-fprofile-arcs' (the
          latter implies the former).

        * Run the program on a representative workload to generate the
          arc profile information.  This may be repeated any number of
          times.  You can run concurrent instances of your program, and
          provided that the file system supports locking, the data
          files will be correctly updated.  Also `fork' calls are
          detected and correctly handled (double counting will not
          happen).

        * For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files
          again with the same optimization and code generation options
          plus `-fbranch-probabilities' (*note Options that Control
          Optimization: Optimize Options.).

        * For test coverage analysis, use `gcov' to produce human
          readable information from the `.gcno' and `.gcda' files.
          Refer to the `gcov' documentation for further information.


     With `-fprofile-arcs', for each function of your program GCC
     creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the
     graph.  Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be
     instrumented: the compiler adds code to count the number of times
     that these arcs are executed.  When an arc is the only exit or
     only entrance to a block, the instrumentation code can be added to
     the block; otherwise, a new basic block must be created to hold
     the instrumentation code.

`-ftest-coverage'
     Produce a notes file that the `gcov' code-coverage utility (*note
     `gcov'--a Test Coverage Program: Gcov.) can use to show program
     coverage.  Each source file's note file is called `AUXNAME.gcno'.
     Refer to the `-fprofile-arcs' option above for a description of
     AUXNAME and instructions on how to generate test coverage data.
     Coverage data will match the source files more closely, if you do
     not optimize.

`-fdbg-cnt-list'
     Print the name and the counter upperbound for all debug counters.

`-fdbg-cnt=COUNTER-VALUE-LIST'
     Set the internal debug counter upperbound. COUNTER-VALUE-LIST is a
     comma-separated list of NAME:VALUE pairs which sets the upperbound
     of each debug counter NAME to VALUE.  All debug counters have the
     initial upperbound of UINT_MAX, thus dbg_cnt() returns true always
     unless the upperbound is set by this option.  e.g. With
     -fdbg-cnt=dce:10,tail_call:0 dbg_cnt(dce) will return true only
     for first 10 invocations and dbg_cnt(tail_call) will return false
     always.

`-dLETTERS'
`-fdump-rtl-PASS'
     Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified
     by LETTERS.  This is used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the
     compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are made by
     appending a pass number and a word to the DUMPNAME, and the files
     are created in the directory of the output file.  DUMPNAME is
     generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified
     and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the basename of the
     source file. These switches may have different effects when `-E'
     is used for preprocessing.

     Debug dumps can be enabled with a `-fdump-rtl' switch or some `-d'
     option LETTERS.  Here are the possible letters for use in PASS and
     LETTERS, and their meanings:

    `-fdump-rtl-alignments'
          Dump after branch alignments have been computed.

    `-fdump-rtl-fwprop1'
    `-fdump-rtl-fwprop2'

          after the two forward propagation passes.

    `-fdump-rtl-gcse1'
    `-fdump-rtl-gcse2'
          `-fdump-rtl-gcse1' and `-fdump-rtl-gcse2' enable dumping

    `-fdump-rtl-split4'
    `-fdump-rtl-split5'
          `-fdump-rtl-split1', `-fdump-rtl-split2',
          `-fdump-rtl-split3', `-fdump-rtl-split4' and
          `-fdump-rtl-split5' enable dumping after five rounds of
          instruction splitting.

    `-fdump-rtl-sms'
          Dump after modulo scheduling.  This pass is only run on some
          architectures.

    `-fdump-rtl-stack'

          registers to the x87's stack-like registers.  This pass is
          only run on x86 variants.

    `-fdump-rtl-subreg1'
    `-fdump-rtl-subreg2'

    `-fdump-rtl-dfinit'
    `-fdump-rtl-dfinish'
          These dumps are defined but always produce empty files.

    `-fdump-rtl-all'
          Produce all the dumps listed above.

          Dump all macro definitions, at the end of preprocessing, in
          addition to normal output.

    `-dH'
          Produce a core dump whenever an error occurs.

          Annotate the assembler output with a comment indicating which
          pattern and alternative was used.  The length of each
          instruction is also printed.

    `-dP'
          Dump the RTL in the assembler output as a comment before each
          instruction.  Also turns on `-dp' annotation.

    `-dv'
          For each of the other indicated dump files
          (`-fdump-rtl-PASS'), dump a representation of the control
          flow graph suitable for viewing with VCG to `FILE.PASS.vcg'.

    `-dx'
          Just generate RTL for a function instead of compiling it.
          Usually used with `-fdump-rtl-expand'.

    `-dy'
          Dump debugging information during parsing, to standard error.

`-fdump-noaddr'
     When doing debugging dumps, suppress address output.  This makes
     it more feasible to use diff on debugging dumps for compiler
     invocations with different compiler binaries and/or different text
     / bss / data / heap / stack / dso start locations.

`-fdump-unnumbered'
     When doing debugging dumps, suppress instruction numbers and
     address output.  This makes it more feasible to use diff on
     debugging dumps for compiler invocations with different options,
     in particular with and without `-g'.

`-fdump-unnumbered-links'
     When doing debugging dumps (see `-d' option above), suppress
     instruction numbers for the links to the previous and next
     instructions in a sequence.

`-fdump-translation-unit (C++ only)'
`-fdump-translation-unit-OPTIONS (C++ only)'
     Dump a representation of the tree structure for the entire
     translation unit to a file.  The file name is made by appending
     `.tu' to the source file name, and the file is created in the same
     directory as the output file.  If the `-OPTIONS' form is used,
     OPTIONS controls the details of the dump as described for the
     `-fdump-tree' options.

`-fdump-class-hierarchy (C++ only)'
`-fdump-class-hierarchy-OPTIONS (C++ only)'
     Dump a representation of each class's hierarchy and virtual
     function table layout to a file.  The file name is made by
     appending `.class' to the source file name, and the file is
     created in the same directory as the output file.  If the
     `-OPTIONS' form is used, OPTIONS controls the details of the dump
     as described for the `-fdump-tree' options.

`-fdump-ipa-SWITCH'
     Control the dumping at various stages of inter-procedural analysis
     language tree to a file.  The file name is generated by appending a
     switch specific suffix to the source file name, and the file is
     created in the same directory as the output file.  The following
     dumps are possible:

    `all'
          Enables all inter-procedural analysis dumps.

    `cgraph'
          Dumps information about call-graph optimization, unused
          function removal, and inlining decisions.

    `inline'
          Dump after function inlining.


`-fdump-statistics-OPTION'
     Enable and control dumping of pass statistics in a separate file.
     The file name is generated by appending a suffix ending in
     `.statistics' to the source file name, and the file is created in
     the same directory as the output file.  If the `-OPTION' form is
     used, `-stats' will cause counters to be summed over the whole
     compilation unit while `-details' will dump every event as the
     passes generate them.  The default with no option is to sum
     counters for each function compiled.

`-fdump-tree-SWITCH'
`-fdump-tree-SWITCH-OPTIONS'
     Control the dumping at various stages of processing the
     intermediate language tree to a file.  The file name is generated
     by appending a switch specific suffix to the source file name, and
     the file is created in the same directory as the output file.  If
     the `-OPTIONS' form is used, OPTIONS is a list of `-' separated
     options that control the details of the dump.  Not all options are
     applicable to all dumps, those which are not meaningful will be
     ignored.  The following options are available

    `address'
          Print the address of each node.  Usually this is not
          meaningful as it changes according to the environment and
          source file.  Its primary use is for tying up a dump file
          with a debug environment.

    `asmname'
          If `DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME' has been set for a given decl, use
          that in the dump instead of `DECL_NAME'.  Its primary use is
          ease of use working backward from mangled names in the
          assembly file.

    `slim'
          Inhibit dumping of members of a scope or body of a function
          merely because that scope has been reached.  Only dump such
          items when they are directly reachable by some other path.
          When dumping pretty-printed trees, this option inhibits
          dumping the bodies of control structures.

    `raw'
          Print a raw representation of the tree.  By default, trees are
          pretty-printed into a C-like representation.

    `details'
          Enable more detailed dumps (not honored by every dump option).

    `stats'
          Enable dumping various statistics about the pass (not honored
          by every dump option).

    `blocks'
          Enable showing basic block boundaries (disabled in raw dumps).

    `vops'
          Enable showing virtual operands for every statement.

    `lineno'
          Enable showing line numbers for statements.

    `uid'
          Enable showing the unique ID (`DECL_UID') for each variable.

    `verbose'
          Enable showing the tree dump for each statement.

    `eh'
          Enable showing the EH region number holding each statement.

    `all'
          Turn on all options, except `raw', `slim', `verbose' and
          `lineno'.

     The following tree dumps are possible:
    `original'
          Dump before any tree based optimization, to `FILE.original'.

    `optimized'
          Dump after all tree based optimization, to `FILE.optimized'.

    `gimple'
          Dump each function before and after the gimplification pass
          to a file.  The file name is made by appending `.gimple' to
          the source file name.

    `cfg'
          Dump the control flow graph of each function to a file.  The
          file name is made by appending `.cfg' to the source file name.

    `vcg'
          Dump the control flow graph of each function to a file in VCG
          format.  The file name is made by appending `.vcg' to the
          source file name.  Note that if the file contains more than
          one function, the generated file cannot be used directly by
          VCG.  You will need to cut and paste each function's graph
          into its own separate file first.

    `ch'
          Dump each function after copying loop headers.  The file name
          is made by appending `.ch' to the source file name.

    `ssa'
          Dump SSA related information to a file.  The file name is
          made by appending `.ssa' to the source file name.

    `alias'
          Dump aliasing information for each function.  The file name
          is made by appending `.alias' to the source file name.

    `ccp'
          Dump each function after CCP.  The file name is made by
          appending `.ccp' to the source file name.

    `storeccp'
          Dump each function after STORE-CCP.  The file name is made by
          appending `.storeccp' to the source file name.

    `pre'
          Dump trees after partial redundancy elimination.  The file
          name is made by appending `.pre' to the source file name.

    `fre'
          Dump trees after full redundancy elimination.  The file name
          is made by appending `.fre' to the source file name.

    `copyprop'
          Dump trees after copy propagation.  The file name is made by
          appending `.copyprop' to the source file name.

    `store_copyprop'
          Dump trees after store copy-propagation.  The file name is
          made by appending `.store_copyprop' to the source file name.

    `dce'
          Dump each function after dead code elimination.  The file
          name is made by appending `.dce' to the source file name.

    `mudflap'
          Dump each function after adding mudflap instrumentation.  The
          file name is made by appending `.mudflap' to the source file
          name.

    `sra'
          Dump each function after performing scalar replacement of
          aggregates.  The file name is made by appending `.sra' to the
          source file name.

    `sink'
          Dump each function after performing code sinking.  The file
          name is made by appending `.sink' to the source file name.

    `dom'
          Dump each function after applying dominator tree
          optimizations.  The file name is made by appending `.dom' to
          the source file name.

    `dse'
          Dump each function after applying dead store elimination.
          The file name is made by appending `.dse' to the source file
          name.

    `phiopt'
          Dump each function after optimizing PHI nodes into
          straightline code.  The file name is made by appending
          `.phiopt' to the source file name.

    `forwprop'
          Dump each function after forward propagating single use
          variables.  The file name is made by appending `.forwprop' to
          the source file name.

    `copyrename'
          Dump each function after applying the copy rename
          optimization.  The file name is made by appending
          `.copyrename' to the source file name.

    `nrv'
          Dump each function after applying the named return value
          optimization on generic trees.  The file name is made by
          appending `.nrv' to the source file name.

    `vect'
          Dump each function after applying vectorization of loops.
          The file name is made by appending `.vect' to the source file
          name.

    `slp'
          Dump each function after applying vectorization of basic
          blocks.  The file name is made by appending `.slp' to the
          source file name.

    `vrp'
          Dump each function after Value Range Propagation (VRP).  The
          file name is made by appending `.vrp' to the source file name.

    `all'
          Enable all the available tree dumps with the flags provided
          in this option.

`-ftree-vectorizer-verbose=N'
     This option controls the amount of debugging output the vectorizer
     prints.  This information is written to standard error, unless
     `-fdump-tree-all' or `-fdump-tree-vect' is specified, in which
     case it is output to the usual dump listing file, `.vect'.  For
     N=0 no diagnostic information is reported.  If N=1 the vectorizer
     reports each loop that got vectorized, and the total number of
     loops that got vectorized.  If N=2 the vectorizer also reports
     non-vectorized loops that passed the first analysis phase
     (vect_analyze_loop_form) - i.e. countable, inner-most, single-bb,
     single-entry/exit loops.  This is the same verbosity level that
     `-fdump-tree-vect-stats' uses.  Higher verbosity levels mean
     either more information dumped for each reported loop, or same
     amount of information reported for more loops: if N=3, vectorizer
     cost model information is reported.  If N=4, alignment related
     information is added to the reports.  If N=5, data-references
     related information (e.g. memory dependences, memory
     access-patterns) is added to the reports.  If N=6, the vectorizer
     reports also non-vectorized inner-most loops that did not pass the
     first analysis phase (i.e., may not be countable, or may have
     complicated control-flow).  If N=7, the vectorizer reports also
     non-vectorized nested loops.  If N=8, SLP related information is
     added to the reports.  For N=9, all the information the vectorizer
     generates during its analysis and transformation is reported.
     This is the same verbosity level that `-fdump-tree-vect-details'
     uses.

`-frandom-seed=STRING'
     This option provides a seed that GCC uses when it would otherwise
     use random numbers.  It is used to generate certain symbol names
     that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used
     to place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files
     that produce them.  You can use the `-frandom-seed' option to
     produce reproducibly identical object files.

     The STRING should be different for every file you compile.

`-fsched-verbose=N'
     On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls
     the amount of debugging output the scheduler prints.  This
     information is written to standard error, unless
     `-fdump-rtl-sched1' or `-fdump-rtl-sched2' is specified, in which
     case it is output to the usual dump listing file, `.sched1' or
     `.sched2' respectively.  However for N greater than nine, the
     output is always printed to standard error.

     For N greater than zero, `-fsched-verbose' outputs the same
     information as `-fdump-rtl-sched1' and `-fdump-rtl-sched2'.  For N
     greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities,
     detailed ready list information and unit/insn info.  For N greater
     than two, it includes RTL at abort point, control-flow and regions
     info.  And for N over four, `-fsched-verbose' also includes
     dependence info.

`-save-temps'
`-save-temps=cwd'
     Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently; place
     them in the current directory and name them based on the source
     file.  Thus, compiling `foo.c' with `-c -save-temps' would produce
     files `foo.i' and `foo.s', as well as `foo.o'.  This creates a
     preprocessed `foo.i' output file even though the compiler now
     normally uses an integrated preprocessor.

     When used in combination with the `-x' command line option,
     `-save-temps' is sensible enough to avoid over writing an input
     source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.  The
     corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
     source file before using `-save-temps'.

     If you invoke GCC in parallel, compiling several different source
     files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or
     the same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it
     is likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere
     with each other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:

          gcc -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&
          gcc -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&

     may result in `foo.i' and `foo.o' being written to simultaneously
     by both compilers.

`-save-temps=obj'
     Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently.  If the
     `-o' option is used, the temporary files are based on the object
     file.  If the `-o' option is not used, the `-save-temps=obj'
     switch behaves like `-save-temps'.

     For example:

          gcc -save-temps=obj -c foo.c
          gcc -save-temps=obj -c bar.c -o dir/xbar.o
          gcc -save-temps=obj foobar.c -o dir2/yfoobar

     would create `foo.i', `foo.s', `dir/xbar.i', `dir/xbar.s',
     `dir2/yfoobar.i', `dir2/yfoobar.s', and `dir2/yfoobar.o'.

`-time[=FILE]'
     Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
     sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and
     assembler (plus the linker if linking is done).

     Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like
     this:

          # cc1 0.12 0.01
          # as 0.00 0.01

     The first number on each line is the "user time", that is time
     spent executing the program itself.  The second number is "system
     time", time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of
     the program.  Both numbers are in seconds.

     With the specification of an output file, the output is appended
     to the named file, and it looks like this:

          0.12 0.01 cc1 OPTIONS
          0.00 0.01 as OPTIONS

     The "user time" and the "system time" are moved before the program
     name, and the options passed to the program are displayed, so that
     one can later tell what file was being compiled, and with which
     options.

`-fvar-tracking'
     Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are
     stored at each position in code.  Better debugging information is
     then generated (if the debugging information format supports this
     information).

     It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (`-Os',
     `-O', `-O2', ...), debugging information (`-g') and the debug info
     format supports it.

`-fvar-tracking-assignments'
     Annotate assignments to user variables early in the compilation and
     attempt to carry the annotations over throughout the compilation
     all the way to the end, in an attempt to improve debug information
     while optimizing.  Use of `-gdwarf-4' is recommended along with it.

     It can be enabled even if var-tracking is disabled, in which case
     annotations will be created and maintained, but discarded at the
     end.

`-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle'
     Toggle `-fvar-tracking-assignments', in the same way that
     `-gtoggle' toggles `-g'.

`-print-file-name=LIBRARY'
     Print the full absolute name of the library file LIBRARY that
     would be used when linking--and don't do anything else.  With this
     option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
     file name.

`-print-multi-directory'
     Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by
     any other switches present in the command line.  This directory is
     supposed to exist in `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.

`-print-multi-lib'
     Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler
     switches that enable them.  The directory name is separated from
     the switches by `;', and each switch starts with an `@' instead of
     the `-', without spaces between multiple switches.  This is
     supposed to ease shell-processing.

`-print-multi-os-directory'
     Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multilib, relative
     to some `lib' subdirectory.  If OS libraries are present in the
     `lib' subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is usually just
     `.', if OS libraries are present in `libSUFFIX' sibling
     directories this prints e.g. `../lib64', `../lib' or `../lib32',
     or if OS libraries are present in `lib/SUBDIR' subdirectories it
     prints e.g. `amd64', `sparcv9' or `ev6'.

`-print-prog-name=PROGRAM'
     Like `-print-file-name', but searches for a program such as `cpp'.

`-print-libgcc-file-name'
     Same as `-print-file-name=libgcc.a'.

     This is useful when you use `-nostdlib' or `-nodefaultlibs' but
     you do want to link with `libgcc.a'.  You can do

          gcc -nostdlib FILES... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`

`-print-search-dirs'
     Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list
     of program and library directories `gcc' will search--and don't do
     anything else.

     This is useful when `gcc' prints the error message `installation
     problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory'.  To resolve
     this you either need to put `cpp0' and the other compiler
     components where `gcc' expects to find them, or you can set the
     environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' to the directory where you
     installed them.  Don't forget the trailing `/'.  *Note Environment
     Variables::.

`-print-sysroot'
     Print the target sysroot directory that will be used during
     compilation.  This is the target sysroot specified either at
     configure time or using the `--sysroot' option, possibly with an
     extra suffix that depends on compilation options.  If no target
     sysroot is specified, the option prints nothing.

`-print-sysroot-headers-suffix'
     Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching for
     headers, or give an error if the compiler is not configured with
     such a suffix--and don't do anything else.

`-dumpmachine'
     Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
     `i686-pc-linux-gnu')--and don't do anything else.

`-dumpversion'
     Print the compiler version (for example, `3.0')--and don't do
     anything else.

`-dumpspecs'
     Print the compiler's built-in specs--and don't do anything else.
     (This is used when GCC itself is being built.)  *Note Spec Files::.

`-feliminate-unused-debug-types'
     Normally, when producing DWARF2 output, GCC will emit debugging
     information for all types declared in a compilation unit,
     regardless of whether or not they are actually used in that
     compilation unit.  Sometimes this is useful, such as if, in the
     debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is not actually
     used in your program (but is declared).  More often, however, this
     results in a significant amount of wasted space.  With this
     option, GCC will avoid producing debug symbol output for types
     that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.

3.10 Options That Control Optimization
======================================

These options control various sorts of optimizations.

 Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.
Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint
between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or
change the program counter to any other statement in the function and
get exactly the results you would expect from the source code.

 Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and
possibly the ability to debug the program.

 The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode
allows the compiler to use information gained from all of the files
when compiling each of them.

 Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.

 Most optimizations are only enabled if an `-O' level is set on the
command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.

 Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly
different set of optimizations may be enabled at each `-O' level than
those listed here.  You can invoke GCC with `-Q --help=optimizers' to
find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.
*Note Overall Options::, for examples.

`-O'
`-O1'
     Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a
     lot more memory for a large function.

     With `-O', the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
     time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal
     of compilation time.

     `-O' turns on the following optimization flags:
          -fauto-inc-dec
          -fcprop-registers
          -fdce
          -fdefer-pop
          -fdelayed-branch
          -fdse
          -fguess-branch-probability
          -fif-conversion2
          -fif-conversion
          -fipa-pure-const
          -fipa-reference
          -fmerge-constants
          -fsplit-wide-types
          -ftree-builtin-call-dce
          -ftree-ccp
          -ftree-ch
          -ftree-copyrename
          -ftree-dce
          -ftree-dominator-opts
          -ftree-dse
          -ftree-forwprop
          -ftree-fre
          -ftree-phiprop
          -ftree-sra
          -ftree-pta
          -ftree-ter
          -funit-at-a-time

     `-O' also turns on `-fomit-frame-pointer' on machines where doing
     so does not interfere with debugging.

`-O2'
     Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported
     optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  As
     compared to `-O', this option increases both compilation time and
     the performance of the generated code.

     `-O2' turns on all optimization flags specified by `-O'.  It also
     turns on the following optimization flags:
          -fthread-jumps
          -falign-functions  -falign-jumps
          -falign-loops  -falign-labels
          -fcaller-saves
          -fcrossjumping
          -fcse-follow-jumps  -fcse-skip-blocks
          -fdelete-null-pointer-checks
          -fexpensive-optimizations
          -fgcse  -fgcse-lm
          -finline-small-functions
          -findirect-inlining
          -fipa-sra
          -foptimize-sibling-calls
          -fpeephole2
          -fregmove
          -freorder-blocks  -freorder-functions
          -frerun-cse-after-loop
          -fsched-interblock  -fsched-spec
          -fschedule-insns  -fschedule-insns2
          -fstrict-aliasing -fstrict-overflow
          -ftree-switch-conversion
          -ftree-pre
          -ftree-vrp

     Please note the warning under `-fgcse' about invoking `-O2' on
     programs that use computed gotos.

`-O3'
     Optimize yet more.  `-O3' turns on all optimizations specified by
     `-O2' and also turns on the `-finline-functions',
     `-funswitch-loops', `-fpredictive-commoning',
     `-fgcse-after-reload' and `-ftree-vectorize' options.

`-O0'
     Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected
     results.  This is the default.

`-Os'
     Optimize for size.  `-Os' enables all `-O2' optimizations that do
     not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
     optimizations designed to reduce code size.

     `-Os' disables the following optimization flags:
          -falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops
          -falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-and-partition
          -fprefetch-loop-arrays  -ftree-vect-loop-version

     If you use multiple `-O' options, with or without level numbers,
     the last such option is the one that is effective.

 Options of the form `-fFLAG' specify machine-independent flags.  Most
flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
`-ffoo' would be `-fno-foo'.  In the table below, only one of the forms
is listed--the one you typically will use.  You can figure out the
other form by either removing `no-' or adding it.

 The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by `-O' options or are related to ones that are.  You can use
the following flags in the rare cases when "fine-tuning" of
optimizations to be performed is desired.

`-fno-default-inline'
     Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they
     are defined inside the class scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when
     you specify `-O', member functions defined inside class scope are
     compiled inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add `inline'
     in front of the member function name.

`-fno-defer-pop'
     Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that
     function returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a
     function call, the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on
     the stack for several function calls and pops them all at once.

     Disabled at levels `-O', `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fforward-propagate'
     Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL.  The pass tries to
     combine two instructions and checks if the result can be
     simplified.  If loop unrolling is active, two passes are performed
     and the second is scheduled after loop unrolling.

     This option is enabled by default at optimization levels `-O',
     `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fomit-frame-pointer'
     Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
     don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
     restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
     in many functions.  *It also makes debugging impossible on some
     machines.*

     On some machines, such as the VAX, this flag has no effect, because
     the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame
     pointer and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
     machine-description macro `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' controls
     whether a target machine supports this flag.  *Note Register
     Usage: (gccint)Registers.

     Enabled at levels `-O', `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-foptimize-sibling-calls'
     Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fno-inline'
     Don't pay attention to the `inline' keyword.  Normally this option
     is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline.
     Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded
     inline.

`-finline-small-functions'
     Integrate functions into their callers when their body is smaller
     than expected function call code (so overall size of program gets
     smaller).  The compiler heuristically decides which functions are
     simple enough to be worth integrating in this way.

     Enabled at level `-O2'.

`-findirect-inlining'
     Inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known at
     compile time thanks to previous inlining.  This option has any
     effect only when inlining itself is turned on by the
     `-finline-functions' or `-finline-small-functions' options.

     Enabled at level `-O2'.

`-finline-functions'
     Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
     heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
     integrating in this way.

     If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function
     is declared `static', then the function is normally not output as
     assembler code in its own right.

     Enabled at level `-O3'.

`-finline-functions-called-once'
     Consider all `static' functions called once for inlining into their
     caller even if they are not marked `inline'.  If a call to a given
     function is integrated, then the function is not output as
     assembler code in its own right.

     Enabled at levels `-O1', `-O2', `-O3' and `-Os'.

`-fearly-inlining'
     Inline functions marked by `always_inline' and functions whose
     body seems smaller than the function call overhead early before
     doing `-fprofile-generate' instrumentation and real inlining pass.
     Doing so makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually
     inlining faster on programs having large chains of nested wrapper
     functions.

     Enabled by default.

`-fipa-sra'
     Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates, removal
     of unused parameters and replacement of parameters passed by
     reference by parameters passed by value.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3' and `-Os'.

`-finline-limit=N'
     By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be inlined.
     This flag allows coarse control of this limit.  N is the size of
     functions that can be inlined in number of pseudo instructions.

     Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which
     may be specified individually by using `--param NAME=VALUE'.  The
     `-finline-limit=N' option sets some of these parameters as follows:

    `max-inline-insns-single'
          is set to N/2.

    `max-inline-insns-auto'
          is set to N/2.

     See below for a documentation of the individual parameters
     controlling inlining and for the defaults of these parameters.

     _Note:_ there may be no value to `-finline-limit' that results in
     default behavior.

     _Note:_ pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context,
     an abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way does it
     represent a count of assembly instructions and as such its exact
     meaning might change from one release to an another.

`-fkeep-inline-functions'
     In C, emit `static' functions that are declared `inline' into the
     object file, even if the function has been inlined into all of its
     callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the `extern
     inline' extension in GNU C90.  In C++, emit any and all inline
     functions into the object file.

`-fkeep-static-consts'
     Emit variables declared `static const' when optimization isn't
     turned on, even if the variables aren't referenced.

     GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the
     compiler to check if the variable was referenced, regardless of
     whether or not optimization is turned on, use the
     `-fno-keep-static-consts' option.

`-fmerge-constants'
     Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and
     floating point constants) across compilation units.

     This option is the default for optimized compilation if the
     assembler and linker support it.  Use `-fno-merge-constants' to
     inhibit this behavior.

     Enabled at levels `-O', `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fmerge-all-constants'
     Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.

     This option implies `-fmerge-constants'.  In addition to
     `-fmerge-constants' this considers e.g. even constant initialized
     arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating
     point types.  Languages like C or C++ require each variable,
     including multiple instances of the same variable in recursive
     calls, to have distinct locations, so using this option will
     result in non-conforming behavior.

`-fmodulo-sched'
     Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first
     scheduling pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders
     their instructions by overlapping different iterations.

`-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves'
     Perform more aggressive SMS based modulo scheduling with register
     moves allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences
     edges will be deleted which will trigger the generation of
     reg-moves based on the life-range analysis.  This option is
     effective only with `-fmodulo-sched' enabled.

`-fno-branch-count-reg'
     Do not use "decrement and branch" instructions on a count register,
     but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a
     register, compare it against zero, then branch based upon the
     result.  This option is only meaningful on architectures that
     support such instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, IA-64 and
     S/390.

     The default is `-fbranch-count-reg'.

`-fno-function-cse'
     Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction
     that calls a constant function contain the function's address
     explicitly.

     This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
     that alter the assembler output may be confused by the
     optimizations performed when this option is not used.

     The default is `-ffunction-cse'

`-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss'
     If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts
     variables that are initialized to zero into BSS.  This can save
     space in the resulting code.

     This option turns off this behavior because some programs
     explicitly rely on variables going to the data section.  E.g., so
     that the resulting executable can find the beginning of that
     section and/or make assumptions based on that.

     The default is `-fzero-initialized-in-bss'.

`-fmudflap -fmudflapth -fmudflapir'
     For front-ends that support it (C and C++), instrument all risky
     pointer/array dereferencing operations, some standard library
     string/heap functions, and some other associated constructs with
     range/validity tests.  Modules so instrumented should be immune to
     buffer overflows, invalid heap use, and some other classes of C/C++
     programming errors.  The instrumentation relies on a separate
     runtime library (`libmudflap'), which will be linked into a
     program if `-fmudflap' is given at link time.  Run-time behavior
     of the instrumented program is controlled by the `MUDFLAP_OPTIONS'
     environment variable.  See `env MUDFLAP_OPTIONS=-help a.out' for
     its options.

     Use `-fmudflapth' instead of `-fmudflap' to compile and to link if
     your program is multi-threaded.  Use `-fmudflapir', in addition to
     `-fmudflap' or `-fmudflapth', if instrumentation should ignore
     pointer reads.  This produces less instrumentation (and therefore
     faster execution) and still provides some protection against
     outright memory corrupting writes, but allows erroneously read
     data to propagate within a program.

`-fthread-jumps'
     Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
     location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.
     If so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of
     the second branch or a point immediately following it, depending
     on whether the condition is known to be true or false.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fsplit-wide-types'
     When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as `long
     long' on a 32-bit system, split the registers apart and allocate
     them independently.  This normally generates better code for those
     types, but may make debugging more difficult.

     Enabled at levels `-O', `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fcse-follow-jumps'
     In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump
     instructions when the target of the jump is not reached by any
     other path.  For example, when CSE encounters an `if' statement
     with an `else' clause, CSE will follow the jump when the condition
     tested is false.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fcse-skip-blocks'
     This is similar to `-fcse-follow-jumps', but causes CSE to follow
     jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE encounters a
     simple `if' statement with no else clause, `-fcse-skip-blocks'
     causes CSE to follow the jump around the body of the `if'.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-frerun-cse-after-loop'
     Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations
     has been performed.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fgcse'
     Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.  This pass
     also performs global constant and copy propagation.

     _Note:_ When compiling a program using computed gotos, a GCC
     extension, you may get better runtime performance if you disable
     the global common subexpression elimination pass by adding
     `-fno-gcse' to the command line.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fgcse-lm'
     When `-fgcse-lm' is enabled, global common subexpression
     elimination will attempt to move loads which are only killed by
     stores into themselves.  This allows a loop containing a
     load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside the loop, and
     a copy/store within the loop.

     Enabled by default when gcse is enabled.

`-fgcse-sm'
     When `-fgcse-sm' is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
     global common subexpression elimination.  This pass will attempt
     to move stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with
     `-fgcse-lm', loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed
     to a load before the loop and a store after the loop.

     Not enabled at any optimization level.

`-fgcse-las'
     When `-fgcse-las' is enabled, the global common subexpression
     elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after stores
     to the same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).

     Not enabled at any optimization level.

`-fgcse-after-reload'
     When `-fgcse-after-reload' is enabled, a redundant load elimination
     pass is performed after reload.  The purpose of this pass is to
     cleanup redundant spilling.

`-funsafe-loop-optimizations'
     If given, the loop optimizer will assume that loop indices do not
     overflow, and that the loops with nontrivial exit condition are not
     infinite.  This enables a wider range of loop optimizations even if
     the loop optimizer itself cannot prove that these assumptions are
     valid.  Using `-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations', the compiler will
     warn you if it finds this kind of loop.

`-fcrossjumping'
     Perform cross-jumping transformation.  This transformation unifies
     equivalent code and save code size.  The resulting code may or may
     not perform better than without cross-jumping.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fauto-inc-dec'
     Combine increments or decrements of addresses with memory accesses.
     This pass is always skipped on architectures that do not have
     instructions to support this.  Enabled by default at `-O' and
     higher on architectures that support this.

`-fdce'
     Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on RTL.  Enabled by default at
     `-O' and higher.

`-fdse'
     Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on RTL.  Enabled by default
     at `-O' and higher.

`-fif-conversion'
     Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less
     equivalents.  This include use of conditional moves, min, max, set
     flags and abs instructions, and some tricks doable by standard
     arithmetics.  The use of conditional execution on chips where it
     is available is controlled by `if-conversion2'.

     Enabled at levels `-O', `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fif-conversion2'
     Use conditional execution (where available) to transform
     conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.

     Enabled at levels `-O', `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fdelete-null-pointer-checks'
     Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and
     that no code or data element resides there.  This enables simple
     constant folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In
     addition, other optimization passes in GCC use this flag to
     control global dataflow analyses that eliminate useless checks for
     null pointers; these assume that if a pointer is checked after it
     has already been dereferenced, it cannot be null.

     Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true.
     Use `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks' to disable this optimization
     for programs which depend on that behavior.

     Some targets, especially embedded ones, disable this option at all
     levels.  Otherwise it is enabled at all levels: `-O0', `-O1',
     `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.  Passes that use the information are enabled
     independently at different optimization levels.

`-fexpensive-optimizations'
     Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively
     expensive.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-foptimize-register-move'
`-fregmove'
     Attempt to reassign register numbers in move instructions and as
     operands of other simple instructions in order to maximize the
     amount of register tying.  This is especially helpful on machines
     with two-operand instructions.

     Note `-fregmove' and `-foptimize-register-move' are the same
     optimization.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fira-algorithm=ALGORITHM'
     Use specified coloring algorithm for the integrated register
     allocator.  The ALGORITHM argument should be `priority' or `CB'.
     The first algorithm specifies Chow's priority coloring, the second
     one specifies Chaitin-Briggs coloring.  The second algorithm can
     be unimplemented for some architectures.  If it is implemented, it
     is the default because Chaitin-Briggs coloring as a rule generates
     a better code.

`-fira-region=REGION'
     Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.  The
     REGION argument should be one of `all', `mixed', or `one'.  The
     first value means using all loops as register allocation regions,
     the second value which is the default means using all loops except
     for loops with small register pressure as the regions, and third
     one means using all function as a single region.  The first value
     can give best result for machines with small size and irregular
     register set, the third one results in faster and generates decent
     code and the smallest size code, and the default value usually
     give the best results in most cases and for most architectures.

`-fira-coalesce'
     Do optimistic register coalescing.  This option might be
     profitable for architectures with big regular register files.

`-fira-loop-pressure'
     Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in loops for decision to move
     loop invariants.  Usage of this option usually results in
     generation of faster and smaller code on machines with big
     register files (>= 32 registers) but it can slow compiler down.

     This option is enabled at level `-O3' for some targets.

`-fno-ira-share-save-slots'
     Switch off sharing stack slots used for saving call used hard
     registers living through a call.  Each hard register will get a
     separate stack slot and as a result function stack frame will be
     bigger.

`-fno-ira-share-spill-slots'
     Switch off sharing stack slots allocated for pseudo-registers.
     Each pseudo-register which did not get a hard register will get a
     separate stack slot and as a result function stack frame will be
     bigger.

`-fira-verbose=N'
     Set up how verbose dump file for the integrated register allocator
     will be.  Default value is 5.  If the value is greater or equal to
     10, the dump file will be stderr as if the value were N minus 10.

`-fdelayed-branch'
     If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
     instructions to exploit instruction slots available after delayed
     branch instructions.

     Enabled at levels `-O', `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fschedule-insns'
     If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
     instructions to eliminate execution stalls due to required data
     being unavailable.  This helps machines that have slow floating
     point or memory load instructions by allowing other instructions
     to be issued until the result of the load or floating point
     instruction is required.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3'.

`-fschedule-insns2'
     Similar to `-fschedule-insns', but requests an additional pass of
     instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.
     This is especially useful on machines with a relatively small
     number of registers and where memory load instructions take more
     than one cycle.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fno-sched-interblock'
     Don't schedule instructions across basic blocks.  This is normally
     enabled by default when scheduling before register allocation, i.e.
     with `-fschedule-insns' or at `-O2' or higher.

`-fno-sched-spec'
     Don't allow speculative motion of non-load instructions.  This is
     normally enabled by default when scheduling before register
     allocation, i.e.  with `-fschedule-insns' or at `-O2' or higher.

`-fsched-pressure'
     Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before the
     register allocation.  This only makes sense when scheduling before
     register allocation is enabled, i.e. with `-fschedule-insns' or at
     `-O2' or higher.  Usage of this option can improve the generated
     code and decrease its size by preventing register pressure
     increase above the number of available hard registers and as a
     consequence register spills in the register allocation.

`-fsched-spec-load'
     Allow speculative motion of some load instructions.  This only
     makes sense when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
     `-fschedule-insns' or at `-O2' or higher.

`-fsched-spec-load-dangerous'
     Allow speculative motion of more load instructions.  This only
     makes sense when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
     `-fschedule-insns' or at `-O2' or higher.

`-fsched-stalled-insns'
`-fsched-stalled-insns=N'
     Define how many insns (if any) can be moved prematurely from the
     queue of stalled insns into the ready list, during the second
     scheduling pass.  `-fno-sched-stalled-insns' means that no insns
     will be moved prematurely, `-fsched-stalled-insns=0' means there
     is no limit on how many queued insns can be moved prematurely.
     `-fsched-stalled-insns' without a value is equivalent to
     `-fsched-stalled-insns=1'.

`-fsched-stalled-insns-dep'
`-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=N'
     Define how many insn groups (cycles) will be examined for a
     dependency on a stalled insn that is candidate for premature
     removal from the queue of stalled insns.  This has an effect only
     during the second scheduling pass, and only if
     `-fsched-stalled-insns' is used.  `-fno-sched-stalled-insns-dep'
     is equivalent to `-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=0'.
     `-fsched-stalled-insns-dep' without a value is equivalent to
     `-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=1'.

`-fsched2-use-superblocks'
     When scheduling after register allocation, do use superblock
     scheduling algorithm.  Superblock scheduling allows motion across
     basic block boundaries resulting on faster schedules.  This option
     is experimental, as not all machine descriptions used by GCC model
     the CPU closely enough to avoid unreliable results from the
     algorithm.

     This only makes sense when scheduling after register allocation,
     i.e. with `-fschedule-insns2' or at `-O2' or higher.

`-fsched-group-heuristic'
     Enable the group heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors
     the instruction that belongs to a schedule group.  This is enabled
     by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with `-fschedule-insns'
     or `-fschedule-insns2' or at `-O2' or higher.

`-fsched-critical-path-heuristic'
     Enable the critical-path heuristic in the scheduler.  This
     heuristic favors instructions on the critical path.  This is
     enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with
     `-fschedule-insns' or `-fschedule-insns2' or at `-O2' or higher.

`-fsched-spec-insn-heuristic'
     Enable the speculative instruction heuristic in the scheduler.
     This heuristic favors speculative instructions with greater
     dependency weakness.  This is enabled by default when scheduling
     is enabled, i.e.  with `-fschedule-insns' or `-fschedule-insns2'
     or at `-O2' or higher.

`-fsched-rank-heuristic'
     Enable the rank heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors
     the instruction belonging to a basic block with greater size or
     frequency.  This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled,
     i.e.  with `-fschedule-insns' or `-fschedule-insns2' or at `-O2'
     or higher.

`-fsched-last-insn-heuristic'
     Enable the last-instruction heuristic in the scheduler.  This
     heuristic favors the instruction that is less dependent on the
     last instruction scheduled.  This is enabled by default when
     scheduling is enabled, i.e. with `-fschedule-insns' or
     `-fschedule-insns2' or at `-O2' or higher.

`-fsched-dep-count-heuristic'
     Enable the dependent-count heuristic in the scheduler.  This
     heuristic favors the instruction that has more instructions
     depending on it.  This is enabled by default when scheduling is
     enabled, i.e.  with `-fschedule-insns' or `-fschedule-insns2' or
     at `-O2' or higher.

`-freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops'
     The modulo scheduling comes before the traditional scheduling, if
     a loop was modulo scheduled we may want to prevent the later
     scheduling passes from changing its schedule, we use this option
     to control that.

`-fselective-scheduling'
     Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.
     Selective scheduling runs instead of the first scheduler pass.

`-fselective-scheduling2'
     Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.
     Selective scheduling runs instead of the second scheduler pass.

`-fsel-sched-pipelining'
     Enable software pipelining of innermost loops during selective
     scheduling.  This option has no effect until one of
     `-fselective-scheduling' or `-fselective-scheduling2' is turned on.

`-fsel-sched-pipelining-outer-loops'
     When pipelining loops during selective scheduling, also pipeline
     outer loops.  This option has no effect until
     `-fsel-sched-pipelining' is turned on.

`-fcaller-saves'
     Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be clobbered
     by function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and
     restore the registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done
     only when it seems to result in better code than would otherwise
     be produced.

     This option is always enabled by default on certain machines,
     usually those which have no call-preserved registers to use
     instead.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fconserve-stack'
     Attempt to minimize stack usage.  The compiler will attempt to use
     less stack space, even if that makes the program slower.  This
     option implies setting the `large-stack-frame' parameter to 100
     and the `large-stack-frame-growth' parameter to 400.

`-ftree-reassoc'
     Perform reassociation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
     at `-O' and higher.

`-ftree-pre'
     Perform partial redundancy elimination (PRE) on trees.  This flag
     is enabled by default at `-O2' and `-O3'.

`-ftree-forwprop'
     Perform forward propagation on trees.  This flag is enabled by
     default at `-O' and higher.

`-ftree-fre'
     Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees.  The difference
     between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers expressions that
     are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.
     This analysis is faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer
     redundancies.  This flag is enabled by default at `-O' and higher.

`-ftree-phiprop'
     Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on trees.  This
     pass is enabled by default at `-O' and higher.

`-ftree-copy-prop'
     Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates
     unnecessary copy operations.  This flag is enabled by default at
     `-O' and higher.

`-fipa-pure-const'
     Discover which functions are pure or constant.  Enabled by default
     at `-O' and higher.

`-fipa-reference'
     Discover which static variables do not escape cannot escape the
     compilation unit.  Enabled by default at `-O' and higher.

`-fipa-struct-reorg'
     Perform structure reorganization optimization, that change C-like
     structures layout in order to better utilize spatial locality.
     This transformation is affective for programs containing arrays of
     structures.  Available in two compilation modes: profile-based
     (enabled with `-fprofile-generate') or static (which uses built-in
     heuristics).  Require `-fipa-type-escape' to provide the safety of
     this transformation.  It works only in whole program mode, so it
     requires `-fwhole-program' and `-combine' to be enabled.
     Structures considered `cold' by this transformation are not
     affected (see `--param struct-reorg-cold-struct-ratio=VALUE').

     With this flag, the program debug info reflects a new structure
     layout.

`-fipa-pta'
     Perform interprocedural pointer analysis.  This option is
     experimental and does not affect generated code.

`-fipa-cp'
     Perform interprocedural constant propagation.  This optimization
     analyzes the program to determine when values passed to functions
     are constants and then optimizes accordingly.  This optimization
     can substantially increase performance if the application has
     constants passed to functions.  This flag is enabled by default at
     `-O2', `-Os' and `-O3'.

`-fipa-cp-clone'
     Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant
     propagation stronger.  When enabled, interprocedural constant
     propagation will perform function cloning when externally visible
     function can be called with constant arguments.  Because this
     optimization can create multiple copies of functions, it may
     significantly increase code size (see `--param
     ipcp-unit-growth=VALUE').  This flag is enabled by default at
     `-O3'.

`-fipa-matrix-reorg'
     Perform matrix flattening and transposing.  Matrix flattening
     tries to replace an m-dimensional matrix with its equivalent
     n-dimensional matrix, where n < m.  This reduces the level of
     indirection needed for accessing the elements of the matrix. The
     second optimization is matrix transposing that attempts to change
     the order of the matrix's dimensions in order to improve cache
     locality.  Both optimizations need the `-fwhole-program' flag.
     Transposing is enabled only if profiling information is available.

`-ftree-sink'
     Perform forward store motion  on trees.  This flag is enabled by
     default at `-O' and higher.

`-ftree-ccp'
     Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (CCP) on trees.
     This pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled
     by default at `-O' and higher.

`-ftree-switch-conversion'
     Perform conversion of simple initializations in a switch to
     initializations from a scalar array.  This flag is enabled by
     default at `-O2' and higher.

`-ftree-dce'
     Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on trees.  This flag is
     enabled by default at `-O' and higher.

`-ftree-builtin-call-dce'
     Perform conditional dead code elimination (DCE) for calls to
     builtin functions that may set `errno' but are otherwise
     side-effect free.  This flag is enabled by default at `-O2' and
     higher if `-Os' is not also specified.

`-ftree-dominator-opts'
     Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
     propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and
     expression simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.
     This also performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This
     flag is enabled by default at `-O' and higher.

`-ftree-dse'
     Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees.  A dead store is a
     store into a memory location which will later be overwritten by
     another store without any intervening loads.  In this case the
     earlier store can be deleted.  This flag is enabled by default at
     `-O' and higher.

`-ftree-ch'
     Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it
     increases effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also
     saves one jump.  This flag is enabled by default at `-O' and
     higher.  It is not enabled for `-Os', since it usually increases
     code size.

`-ftree-loop-optimize'
     Perform loop optimizations on trees.  This flag is enabled by
     default at `-O' and higher.

`-ftree-loop-linear'
     Perform linear loop transformations on tree.  This flag can
     improve cache performance and allow further loop optimizations to
     take place.

`-floop-interchange'
     Perform loop interchange transformations on loops.  Interchanging
     two nested loops switches the inner and outer loops.  For example,
     given a loop like:
          DO J = 1, M
            DO I = 1, N
              A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
     loop interchange will transform the loop as if the user had
     written:
          DO I = 1, N
            DO J = 1, M
              A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
     which can be beneficial when `N' is larger than the caches,
     because in Fortran, the elements of an array are stored in memory
     contiguously by column, and the original loop iterates over rows,
     potentially creating at each access a cache miss.  This
     optimization applies to all the languages supported by GCC and is
     not limited to Fortran.  To use this code transformation, GCC has
     to be configured with `--with-ppl' and `--with-cloog' to enable the
     Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.

`-floop-strip-mine'
     Perform loop strip mining transformations on loops.  Strip mining
     splits a loop into two nested loops.  The outer loop has strides
     equal to the strip size and the inner loop has strides of the
     original loop within a strip.  The strip length can be changed
     using the `loop-block-tile-size' parameter.  For example, given a
     loop like:
          DO I = 1, N
            A(I) = A(I) + C
          ENDDO
     loop strip mining will transform the loop as if the user had
     written:
          DO II = 1, N, 51
            DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
              A(I) = A(I) + C
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
     This optimization applies to all the languages supported by GCC
     and is not limited to Fortran.  To use this code transformation,
     GCC has to be configured with `--with-ppl' and `--with-cloog' to
     enable the Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.

`-floop-block'
     Perform loop blocking transformations on loops.  Blocking strip
     mines each loop in the loop nest such that the memory accesses of
     the element loops fit inside caches.  The strip length can be
     changed using the `loop-block-tile-size' parameter.  For example,
     given a loop like:
          DO I = 1, N
            DO J = 1, M
              A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
     loop blocking will transform the loop as if the user had written:
          DO II = 1, N, 51
            DO JJ = 1, M, 51
              DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
                DO J = JJ, min (JJ + 50, M)
                  A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
                ENDDO
              ENDDO
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
     which can be beneficial when `M' is larger than the caches,
     because the innermost loop will iterate over a smaller amount of
     data that can be kept in the caches.  This optimization applies to
     all the languages supported by GCC and is not limited to Fortran.
     To use this code transformation, GCC has to be configured with
     `--with-ppl' and `--with-cloog' to enable the Graphite loop
     transformation infrastructure.

`-fgraphite-identity'
     Enable the identity transformation for graphite.  For every SCoP
     we generate the polyhedral representation and transform it back to
     gimple.  Using `-fgraphite-identity' we can check the costs or
     benefits of the GIMPLE -> GRAPHITE -> GIMPLE transformation.  Some
     minimal optimizations are also performed by the code generator
     CLooG, like index splitting and dead code elimination in loops.

`-floop-parallelize-all'
     Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to identify loops that
     can be parallelized.  Parallelize all the loops that can be
     analyzed to not contain loop carried dependences without checking
     that it is profitable to parallelize the loops.

`-fcheck-data-deps'
     Compare the results of several data dependence analyzers.  This
     option is used for debugging the data dependence analyzers.

`-ftree-loop-distribution'
     Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache
     performance on big loop bodies and allow further loop
     optimizations, like parallelization or vectorization, to take
     place.  For example, the loop
          DO I = 1, N
            A(I) = B(I) + C
            D(I) = E(I) * F
          ENDDO
     is transformed to
          DO I = 1, N
             A(I) = B(I) + C
          ENDDO
          DO I = 1, N
             D(I) = E(I) * F
          ENDDO

`-ftree-loop-im'
     Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only
     invariants that would be hard to handle at RTL level (function
     calls, operations that expand to nontrivial sequences of insns).
     With `-funswitch-loops' it also moves operands of conditions that
     are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use just trivial
     invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
     store motion.

`-ftree-loop-ivcanon'
     Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in the loop
     for that determining number of iterations requires complicated
     analysis.  Later optimizations then may determine the number
     easily.  Useful especially in connection with unrolling.

`-fivopts'
     Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction,
     induction variable merging and induction variable elimination) on
     trees.

`-ftree-parallelize-loops=n'
     Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n
     threads.  This is only possible for loops whose iterations are
     independent and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is
     only profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are
     CPU-intensive, rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.
     This option implies `-pthread', and thus is only supported on
     targets that have support for `-pthread'.

`-ftree-pta'
     Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees.  This flag is
     enabled by default at `-O' and higher.

`-ftree-sra'
     Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces
     structure references with scalars to prevent committing structures
     to memory too early.  This flag is enabled by default at `-O' and
     higher.

`-ftree-copyrename'
     Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename
     compiler temporaries to other variables at copy locations, usually
     resulting in variable names which more closely resemble the
     original variables.  This flag is enabled by default at `-O' and
     higher.

`-ftree-ter'
     Perform temporary expression replacement during the SSA->normal
     phase.  Single use/single def temporaries are replaced at their
     use location with their defining expression.  This results in
     non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders much more complex trees
     to work on resulting in better RTL generation.  This is enabled by
     default at `-O' and higher.

`-ftree-vectorize'
     Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by
     default at `-O3'.

`-ftree-slp-vectorize'
     Perform basic block vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled
     by default at `-O3' and when `-ftree-vectorize' is enabled.

`-ftree-vect-loop-version'
     Perform loop versioning when doing loop vectorization on trees.
     When a loop appears to be vectorizable except that data alignment
     or data dependence cannot be determined at compile time then
     vectorized and non-vectorized versions of the loop are generated
     along with runtime checks for alignment or dependence to control
     which version is executed.  This option is enabled by default
     except at level `-Os' where it is disabled.

`-fvect-cost-model'
     Enable cost model for vectorization.

`-ftree-vrp'
     Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
     constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values
     are propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary
     range checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.
     This is enabled by default at `-O2' and higher.  Null pointer check
     elimination is only done if `-fdelete-null-pointer-checks' is
     enabled.

`-ftracer'
     Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This
     transformation simplifies the control flow of the function
     allowing other optimizations to do better job.

`-funroll-loops'
     Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at
     compile time or upon entry to the loop.  `-funroll-loops' implies
     `-frerun-cse-after-loop'.  This option makes code larger, and may
     or may not make it run faster.

`-funroll-all-loops'
     Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain
     when the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more
     slowly.  `-funroll-all-loops' implies the same options as
     `-funroll-loops',

`-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller'
     Enables expressing of values of induction variables in later
     iterations of the unrolled loop using the value in the first
     iteration.  This breaks long dependency chains, thus improving
     efficiency of the scheduling passes.

     Combination of `-fweb' and CSE is often sufficient to obtain the
     same effect.  However in cases the loop body is more complicated
     than a single basic block, this is not reliable.  It also does not
     work at all on some of the architectures due to restrictions in
     the CSE pass.

     This optimization is enabled by default.

`-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller'
     With this option, the compiler will create multiple copies of some
     local variables when unrolling a loop which can result in superior
     code.

`-fpredictive-commoning'
     Perform predictive commoning optimization, i.e., reusing
     computations (especially memory loads and stores) performed in
     previous iterations of loops.

     This option is enabled at level `-O3'.

`-fprefetch-loop-arrays'
     If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to
     prefetch memory to improve the performance of loops that access
     large arrays.

     This option may generate better or worse code; results are highly
     dependent on the structure of loops within the source code.

     Disabled at level `-Os'.

`-fno-peephole'
`-fno-peephole2'
     Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.  The
     difference between `-fno-peephole' and `-fno-peephole2' is in how
     they are implemented in the compiler; some targets use one, some
     use the other, a few use both.

     `-fpeephole' is enabled by default.  `-fpeephole2' enabled at
     levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fno-guess-branch-probability'
     Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.

     GCC will use heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
     not provided by profiling feedback (`-fprofile-arcs').  These
     heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch
     probabilities are specified by `__builtin_expect', then the
     heuristics will be used to guess branch probabilities for the rest
     of the control flow graph, taking the `__builtin_expect' info into
     account.  The interactions between the heuristics and
     `__builtin_expect' can be complex, and in some cases, it may be
     useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects of
     `__builtin_expect' are easier to understand.

     The default is `-fguess-branch-probability' at levels `-O', `-O2',
     `-O3', `-Os'.

`-freorder-blocks'
     Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to reduce
     number of taken branches and improve code locality.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3'.

`-freorder-blocks-and-partition'
     In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function,
     in order to reduce number of taken branches, partitions hot and
     cold basic blocks into separate sections of the assembly and .o
     files, to improve paging and cache locality performance.

     This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of
     exception handling, for linkonce sections, for functions with a
     user-defined section attribute and on any architecture that does
     not support named sections.

`-freorder-functions'
     Reorder functions in the object file in order to improve code
     locality.  This is implemented by using special subsections
     `.text.hot' for most frequently executed functions and
     `.text.unlikely' for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is
     done by the linker so object file format must support named
     sections and linker must place them in a reasonable way.

     Also profile feedback must be available in to make this option
     effective.  See `-fprofile-arcs' for details.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fstrict-aliasing'
     Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules
     applicable to the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this
     activates optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In
     particular, an object of one type is assumed never to reside at
     the same address as an object of a different type, unless the
     types are almost the same.  For example, an `unsigned int' can
     alias an `int', but not a `void*' or a `double'.  A character type
     may alias any other type.

     Pay special attention to code like this:
          union a_union {
            int i;
            double d;
          };

          int f() {
            union a_union t;
            t.d = 3.0;
            return t.i;
          }
     The practice of reading from a different union member than the one
     most recently written to (called "type-punning") is common.  Even
     with `-fstrict-aliasing', type-punning is allowed, provided the
     memory is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above
     will work as expected.  *Note Structures unions enumerations and
     bit-fields implementation::.  However, this code might not:
          int f() {
            union a_union t;
            int* ip;
            t.d = 3.0;
            ip = &t.i;
            return *ip;
          }

     Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting
     pointer and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even
     if the cast uses a union type, e.g.:
          int f() {
            double d = 3.0;
            return ((union a_union *) &d)->i;
          }

     The `-fstrict-aliasing' option is enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3',
     `-Os'.

`-fstrict-overflow'
     Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules,
     depending on the language being compiled.  For C (and C++) this
     means that overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is
     undefined, which means that the compiler may assume that it will
     not happen.  This permits various optimizations.  For example, the
     compiler will assume that an expression like `i + 10 > i' will
     always be true for signed `i'.  This assumption is only valid if
     signed overflow is undefined, as the expression is false if `i +
     10' overflows when using twos complement arithmetic.  When this
     option is in effect any attempt to determine whether an operation
     on signed numbers will overflow must be written carefully to not
     actually involve overflow.

     This option also allows the compiler to assume strict pointer
     semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding an offset to
     that pointer does not produce a pointer to the same object, the
     addition is undefined.  This permits the compiler to conclude that
     `p + u > p' is always true for a pointer `p' and unsigned integer
     `u'.  This assumption is only valid because pointer wraparound is
     undefined, as the expression is false if `p + u' overflows using
     twos complement arithmetic.

     See also the `-fwrapv' option.  Using `-fwrapv' means that integer
     signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When `-fwrapv' is
     used, there is no difference between `-fstrict-overflow' and
     `-fno-strict-overflow' for integers.  With `-fwrapv' certain types
     of overflow are permitted.  For example, if the compiler gets an
     overflow when doing arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value
     can still be used with `-fwrapv', but not otherwise.

     The `-fstrict-overflow' option is enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3',
     `-Os'.

`-falign-functions'
`-falign-functions=N'
     Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two greater than
     N, skipping up to N bytes.  For instance, `-falign-functions=32'
     aligns functions to the next 32-byte boundary, but
     `-falign-functions=24' would align to the next 32-byte boundary
     only if this can be done by skipping 23 bytes or less.

     `-fno-align-functions' and `-falign-functions=1' are equivalent
     and mean that functions will not be aligned.

     Some assemblers only support this flag when N is a power of two;
     in that case, it is rounded up.

     If N is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3'.

`-falign-labels'
`-falign-labels=N'
     Align all branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to
     N bytes like `-falign-functions'.  This option can easily make
     code slower, because it must insert dummy operations for when the
     branch target is reached in the usual flow of the code.

     `-fno-align-labels' and `-falign-labels=1' are equivalent and mean
     that labels will not be aligned.

     If `-falign-loops' or `-falign-jumps' are applicable and are
     greater than this value, then their values are used instead.

     If N is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default
     which is very likely to be `1', meaning no alignment.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3'.

`-falign-loops'
`-falign-loops=N'
     Align loops to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to N bytes
     like `-falign-functions'.  The hope is that the loop will be
     executed many times, which will make up for any execution of the
     dummy operations.

     `-fno-align-loops' and `-falign-loops=1' are equivalent and mean
     that loops will not be aligned.

     If N is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3'.

`-falign-jumps'
`-falign-jumps=N'
     Align branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, for branch targets
     where the targets can only be reached by jumping, skipping up to N
     bytes like `-falign-functions'.  In this case, no dummy operations
     need be executed.

     `-fno-align-jumps' and `-falign-jumps=1' are equivalent and mean
     that loops will not be aligned.

     If N is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

     Enabled at levels `-O2', `-O3'.

`-funit-at-a-time'
     This option is left for compatibility reasons. `-funit-at-a-time'
     has no effect, while `-fno-unit-at-a-time' implies
     `-fno-toplevel-reorder' and `-fno-section-anchors'.

     Enabled by default.

`-fno-toplevel-reorder'
     Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and `asm'
     statements.  Output them in the same order that they appear in the
     input file.  When this option is used, unreferenced static
     variables will not be removed.  This option is intended to support
     existing code which relies on a particular ordering.  For new
     code, it is better to use attributes.

     Enabled at level `-O0'.  When disabled explicitly, it also imply
     `-fno-section-anchors' that is otherwise enabled at `-O0' on some
     targets.

`-fweb'
     Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes
     and assign each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the
     register allocation pass to operate on pseudos directly, but also
     strengthens several other optimization passes, such as CSE, loop
     optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can, however, make
     debugging impossible, since variables will no longer stay in a
     "home register".

     Enabled by default with `-funroll-loops'.

`-fwhole-program'
     Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole
     program being compiled.  All public functions and variables with
     the exception of `main' and those merged by attribute
     `externally_visible' become static functions and in effect are
     optimized more aggressively by interprocedural optimizers.  While
     this option is equivalent to proper use of the `static' keyword for
     programs consisting of a single file, in combination with option
     `-combine', `-flto' or `-fwhopr' this flag can be used to compile
     many smaller scale programs since the functions and variables
     become local for the whole combined compilation unit, not for the
     single source file itself.

     This option implies `-fwhole-file' for Fortran programs.

`-flto'
     This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
     with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC's internal
     representations) and writes it to special ELF sections in the
     object file.  When the object files are linked together, all the
     function bodies are read from these ELF sections and instantiated
     as if they had been part of the same translation unit.

     To use the link-timer optimizer, `-flto' needs to be specified at
     compile time and during the final link.  For example,

          gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
          gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
          gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o

     The first two invocations to GCC will save a bytecode
     representation of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside `foo.o'
     and `bar.o'.  The final invocation will read the GIMPLE bytecode
     from `foo.o' and `bar.o', merge the two files into a single
     internal image, and compile the result as usual.  Since both
     `foo.o' and `bar.o' are merged into a single image, this causes
     all the inter-procedural analyses and optimizations in GCC to work
     across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
     for example, that the inliner will be able to inline functions in
     `bar.o' into functions in `foo.o' and vice-versa.

     Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is,

          gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c

     The above will generate bytecode for `foo.c' and `bar.c', merge
     them together into a single GIMPLE representation and optimize
     them as usual to produce `myprog'.

     The only important thing to keep in mind is that to enable
     link-time optimizations the `-flto' flag needs to be passed to
     both the compile and the link commands.

     Note that when a file is compiled with `-flto', the generated
     object file will be larger than a regular object file because it
     will contain GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual final code.  This
     means that object files with LTO information can be linked as a
     normal object file.  So, in the previous example, if the final
     link is done with

          gcc -o myprog foo.o bar.o

     The only difference will be that no inter-procedural optimizations
     will be applied to produce `myprog'.  The two object files `foo.o'
     and `bar.o' will be simply sent to the regular linker.

     Additionally, the optimization flags used to compile individual
     files are not necessarily related to those used at link-time.  For
     instance,

          gcc -c -O0 -flto foo.c
          gcc -c -O0 -flto bar.c
          gcc -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o

     This will produce individual object files with unoptimized
     assembler code, but the resulting binary `myprog' will be
     optimized at `-O3'.  Now, if the final binary is generated without
     `-flto', then `myprog' will not be optimized.

     When producing the final binary with `-flto', GCC will only apply
     link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
     Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
     GIMPLE bytecodes and final object code.  GCC will automatically
     select which files to optimize in LTO mode and which files to link
     without further processing.

     There are some code generation flags that GCC will preserve when
     generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link
     stage.  Currently, the following options are saved into the GIMPLE
     bytecode files: `-fPIC', `-fcommon' and all the `-m' target flags.

     At link time, these options are read-in and reapplied.  Note that
     the current implementation makes no attempt at recognizing
     conflicting values for these options.  If two or more files have a
     conflicting value (e.g., one file is compiled with `-fPIC' and
     another isn't), the compiler will simply use the last value read
     from the bytecode files.  It is recommended, then, that all the
     files participating in the same link be compiled with the same
     options.

     Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply
     interprocedural optimizations on files written in different
     languages.  This requires some support in the language front end.
     Currently, the C, C++ and Fortran front ends are capable of
     emitting GIMPLE bytecodes, so something like this should work

          gcc -c -flto foo.c
          g++ -c -flto bar.cc
          gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
          g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran

     Notice that the final link is done with `g++' to get the C++
     runtime libraries and `-lgfortran' is added to get the Fortran
     runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode,
     you should use the same link command used when mixing languages in
     a regular (non-LTO) compilation.  This means that if your build
     process was mixing languages before, all you need to add is
     `-flto' to all the compile and link commands.

     If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
     types in separate translation units to be linked together
     (undefined behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal
     diagnostic may be issued.  The behavior is still undefined at
     runtime.

     If object files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library
     archive, say `libfoo.a', it is possible to extract and use them in
     an LTO link if you are using `gold' as the linker (which, in turn
     requires GCC to be configured with `--enable-gold').  To enable
     this feature, use the flag `-fuse-linker-plugin' at link-time:

          gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo

     With the linker plugin enabled, `gold' will extract the needed
     GIMPLE files from `libfoo.a' and pass them on to the running GCC
     to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.

     If you are not using `gold' and/or do not specify
     `-fuse-linker-plugin' then the objects inside `libfoo.a' will be
     extracted and linked as usual, but they will not participate in
     the LTO optimization process.

     Link time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole
     program to operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to
     be exported, it is possible to combine `-flto' and `-fwhopr' with
     `-fwhole-program' to allow the interprocedural optimizers to use
     more aggressive assumptions which may lead to improved
     optimization opportunities.

     Regarding portability: the current implementation of LTO makes no
     attempt at generating bytecode that can be ported between different
     types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
     strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
     GCC will not work with an older/newer version of GCC.

     Link time optimization does not play well with generating debugging
     information.  Combining `-flto' or `-fwhopr' with `-g' is
     experimental.

     This option is disabled by default.

`-fwhopr'
     This option is identical in functionality to `-flto' but it
     differs in how the final link stage is executed.  Instead of
     loading all the function bodies in memory, the callgraph is
     analyzed and optimization decisions are made (whole program
     analysis or WPA). Once optimization decisions are made, the
     callgraph is partitioned and the different sections are compiled
     separately (local transformations or LTRANS).  This process allows
     optimizations on very large programs that otherwise would not fit
     in memory.  This option enables `-fwpa' and `-fltrans'
     automatically.

     Disabled by default.

     This option is experimental.

`-fwpa'
     This is an internal option used by GCC when compiling with
     `-fwhopr'.  You should never need to use it.

     This option runs the link-time optimizer in the
     whole-program-analysis (WPA) mode, which reads in summary
     information from all inputs and performs a whole-program analysis
     based on summary information only.  It generates object files for
     subsequent runs of the link-time optimizer where individual object
     files are optimized using both summary information from the WPA
     mode and the actual function bodies.  It then drives the LTRANS
     phase.

     Disabled by default.

`-fltrans'
     This is an internal option used by GCC when compiling with
     `-fwhopr'.  You should never need to use it.

     This option runs the link-time optimizer in the
     local-transformation (LTRANS) mode, which reads in output from a
     previous run of the LTO in WPA mode.  In the LTRANS mode, LTO
     optimizes an object and produces the final assembly.

     Disabled by default.

`-fltrans-output-list=FILE'
     This is an internal option used by GCC when compiling with
     `-fwhopr'.  You should never need to use it.

     This option specifies a file to which the names of LTRANS output
     files are written.  This option is only meaningful in conjunction
     with `-fwpa'.

     Disabled by default.

`-flto-compression-level=N'
     This option specifies the level of compression used for
     intermediate language written to LTO object files, and is only
     meaningful in conjunction with LTO mode (`-fwhopr', `-flto').
     Valid values are 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression).
     Values outside this range are clamped to either 0 or 9.  If the
     option is not given, a default balanced compression setting is
     used.

`-flto-report'
     Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the
     link-time optimizer.  The contents of this report vary from
     version to version, it is meant to be useful to GCC developers
     when processing object files in LTO mode (via `-fwhopr' or
     `-flto').

     Disabled by default.

`-fuse-linker-plugin'
     Enables the extraction of objects with GIMPLE bytecode information
     from library archives.  This option relies on features available
     only in `gold', so to use this you must configure GCC with
     `--enable-gold'.  See `-flto' for a description on the effect of
     this flag and how to use it.

     Disabled by default.

`-fcprop-registers'
     After register allocation and post-register allocation instruction
     splitting, we perform a copy-propagation pass to try to reduce
     scheduling dependencies and occasionally eliminate the copy.

     Enabled at levels `-O', `-O2', `-O3', `-Os'.

`-fprofile-correction'
     Profiles collected using an instrumented binary for multi-threaded
     programs may be inconsistent due to missed counter updates. When
     this option is specified, GCC will use heuristics to correct or
     smooth out such inconsistencies. By default, GCC will emit an
     error message when an inconsistent profile is detected.

`-fprofile-dir=PATH'
     Set the directory to search the profile data files in to PATH.
     This option affects only the profile data generated by
     `-fprofile-generate', `-ftest-coverage', `-fprofile-arcs' and used
     by `-fprofile-use' and `-fbranch-probabilities' and its related
     options.  By default, GCC will use the current directory as PATH
     thus the profile data file will appear in the same directory as
     the object file.

`-fprofile-generate'
`-fprofile-generate=PATH'
     Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to
     produce profile useful for later recompilation with profile
     feedback based optimization.  You must use `-fprofile-generate'
     both when compiling and when linking your program.

     The following options are enabled: `-fprofile-arcs',
     `-fprofile-values', `-fvpt'.

     If PATH is specified, GCC will look at the PATH to find the
     profile feedback data files. See `-fprofile-dir'.

`-fprofile-use'
`-fprofile-use=PATH'
     Enable profile feedback directed optimizations, and optimizations
     generally profitable only with profile feedback available.

     The following options are enabled: `-fbranch-probabilities',
     `-fvpt', `-funroll-loops', `-fpeel-loops', `-ftracer'

     By default, GCC emits an error message if the feedback profiles do
     not match the source code.  This error can be turned into a
     warning by using `-Wcoverage-mismatch'.  Note this may result in
     poorly optimized code.

     If PATH is specified, GCC will look at the PATH to find the
     profile feedback data files. See `-fprofile-dir'.

 The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating
point arithmetic.  These options trade off between speed and
correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.

`-ffloat-store'
     Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit
     other options that might change whether a floating point value is
     taken from a register or memory.

     This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such
     as the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
     precision than a `double' is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
     x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does
     only good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of
     IEEE floating point.  Use `-ffloat-store' for such programs, after
     modifying them to store all pertinent intermediate computations
     into variables.

`-fexcess-precision=STYLE'
     This option allows further control over excess precision on
     machines where floating-point registers have more precision than
     the IEEE `float' and `double' types and the processor does not
     support operations rounding to those types.  By default,
     `-fexcess-precision=fast' is in effect; this means that operations
     are carried out in the precision of the registers and that it is
     unpredictable when rounding to the types specified in the source
     code takes place.  When compiling C, if
     `-fexcess-precision=standard' is specified then excess precision
     will follow the rules specified in ISO C99; in particular, both
     casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their semantic
     types (whereas `-ffloat-store' only affects assignments).  This
     option is enabled by default for C if a strict conformance option
     such as `-std=c99' is used.

     `-fexcess-precision=standard' is not implemented for languages
     other than C, and has no effect if `-funsafe-math-optimizations'
     or `-ffast-math' is specified.  On the x86, it also has no effect
     if `-mfpmath=sse' or `-mfpmath=sse+387' is specified; in the
     former case, IEEE semantics apply without excess precision, and in
     the latter, rounding is unpredictable.

`-ffast-math'
     Sets `-fno-math-errno', `-funsafe-math-optimizations',
     `-ffinite-math-only', `-fno-rounding-math', `-fno-signaling-nans'
     and `-fcx-limited-range'.

     This option causes the preprocessor macro `__FAST_MATH__' to be
     defined.

     This option is not turned on by any `-O' option since it can
     result in incorrect output for programs which depend on an exact
     implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
     functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do
     not require the guarantees of these specifications.

`-fno-math-errno'
     Do not set ERRNO after calling math functions that are executed
     with a single instruction, e.g., sqrt.  A program that relies on
     IEEE exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
     for speed while maintaining IEEE arithmetic compatibility.

     This option is not turned on by any `-O' option since it can
     result in incorrect output for programs which depend on an exact
     implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
     functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do
     not require the guarantees of these specifications.

     The default is `-fmath-errno'.

     On Darwin systems, the math library never sets `errno'.  There is
     therefore no reason for the compiler to consider the possibility
     that it might, and `-fno-math-errno' is the default.

`-funsafe-math-optimizations'
     Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume
     that arguments and results are valid and (b) may violate IEEE or
     ANSI standards.  When used at link-time, it may include libraries
     or startup files that change the default FPU control word or other
     similar optimizations.

     This option is not turned on by any `-O' option since it can
     result in incorrect output for programs which depend on an exact
     implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
     functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do
     not require the guarantees of these specifications.  Enables
     `-fno-signed-zeros', `-fno-trapping-math', `-fassociative-math'
     and `-freciprocal-math'.

     The default is `-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations'.

`-fassociative-math'
     Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point
     operations.  This violates the ISO C and C++ language standard by
     possibly changing computation result.  NOTE: re-ordering may
     change the sign of zero as well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or
     create underflow or overflow (and thus cannot be used on a code
     which relies on rounding behavior like `(x + 2**52) - 2**52)'.
     May also reorder floating-point comparisons and thus may not be
     used when ordered comparisons are required.  This option requires
     that both `-fno-signed-zeros' and `-fno-trapping-math' be in
     effect.  Moreover, it doesn't make much sense with
     `-frounding-math'. For Fortran the option is automatically enabled
     when both `-fno-signed-zeros' and `-fno-trapping-math' are in
     effect.

     The default is `-fno-associative-math'.

`-freciprocal-math'
     Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of dividing by
     the value if this enables optimizations.  For example `x / y' can
     be replaced with `x * (1/y)' which is useful if `(1/y)' is subject
     to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses
     precision and increases the number of flops operating on the value.

     The default is `-fno-reciprocal-math'.

`-ffinite-math-only'
     Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume that
     arguments and results are not NaNs or +-Infs.

     This option is not turned on by any `-O' option since it can
     result in incorrect output for programs which depend on an exact
     implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
     functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do
     not require the guarantees of these specifications.

     The default is `-fno-finite-math-only'.

`-fno-signed-zeros'
     Allow optimizations for floating point arithmetic that ignore the
     signedness of zero.  IEEE arithmetic specifies the behavior of
     distinct +0.0 and -0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
     of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with
     `-ffinite-math-only').  This option implies that the sign of a
     zero result isn't significant.

     The default is `-fsigned-zeros'.

`-fno-trapping-math'
     Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot
     generate user-visible traps.  These traps include division by
     zero, overflow, underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.
     This option requires that `-fno-signaling-nans' be in effect.
     Setting this option may allow faster code if one relies on
     "non-stop" IEEE arithmetic, for example.

     This option should never be turned on by any `-O' option since it
     can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on an
     exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
     functions.

     The default is `-ftrapping-math'.

`-frounding-math'
     Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default
     floating point rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all
     floating point to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for
     all other arithmetic truncations.  This option should be specified
     for programs that change the FP rounding mode dynamically, or that
     may be executed with a non-default rounding mode.  This option
     disables constant folding of floating point expressions at
     compile-time (which may be affected by rounding mode) and
     arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the presence of
     sign-dependent rounding modes.

     The default is `-fno-rounding-math'.

     This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
     disable all GCC optimizations that are affected by rounding mode.
     Future versions of GCC may provide finer control of this setting
     using C99's `FENV_ACCESS' pragma.  This command line option will
     be used to specify the default state for `FENV_ACCESS'.

`-fsignaling-nans'
     Compile code assuming that IEEE signaling NaNs may generate
     user-visible traps during floating-point operations.  Setting this
     option disables optimizations that may change the number of
     exceptions visible with signaling NaNs.  This option implies
     `-ftrapping-math'.

     This option causes the preprocessor macro `__SUPPORT_SNAN__' to be
     defined.

     The default is `-fno-signaling-nans'.

     This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
     disable all GCC optimizations that affect signaling NaN behavior.

`-fsingle-precision-constant'
     Treat floating point constant as single precision constant instead
     of implicitly converting it to double precision constant.

`-fcx-limited-range'
     When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step is not
     needed when performing complex division.  Also, there is no
     checking whether the result of a complex multiplication or
     division is `NaN + I*NaN', with an attempt to rescue the situation
     in that case.  The default is `-fno-cx-limited-range', but is
     enabled by `-ffast-math'.

     This option controls the default setting of the ISO C99
     `CX_LIMITED_RANGE' pragma.  Nevertheless, the option applies to
     all languages.

`-fcx-fortran-rules'
     Complex multiplication and division follow Fortran rules.  Range
     reduction is done as part of complex division, but there is no
     checking whether the result of a complex multiplication or
     division is `NaN + I*NaN', with an attempt to rescue the situation
     in that case.

     The default is `-fno-cx-fortran-rules'.


 The following options control optimizations that may improve
performance, but are not enabled by any `-O' options.  This section
includes experimental options that may produce broken code.

`-fbranch-probabilities'
     After running a program compiled with `-fprofile-arcs' (*note
     Options for Debugging Your Program or `gcc': Debugging Options.),
     you can compile it a second time using `-fbranch-probabilities',
     to improve optimizations based on the number of times each branch
     was taken.  When the program compiled with `-fprofile-arcs' exits
     it saves arc execution counts to a file called `SOURCENAME.gcda'
     for each source file.  The information in this data file is very
     dependent on the structure of the generated code, so you must use
     the same source code and the same optimization options for both
     compilations.

     With `-fbranch-probabilities', GCC puts a `REG_BR_PROB' note on
     each `JUMP_INSN' and `CALL_INSN'.  These can be used to improve
     optimization.  Currently, they are only used in one place: in
     `reorg.c', instead of guessing which path a branch is mostly to
     take, the `REG_BR_PROB' values are used to exactly determine which
     path is taken more often.

`-fprofile-values'
     If combined with `-fprofile-arcs', it adds code so that some data
     about values of expressions in the program is gathered.

     With `-fbranch-probabilities', it reads back the data gathered
     from profiling values of expressions and adds `REG_VALUE_PROFILE'
     notes to instructions for their later usage in optimizations.

     Enabled with `-fprofile-generate' and `-fprofile-use'.

`-fvpt'
     If combined with `-fprofile-arcs', it instructs the compiler to add
     a code to gather information about values of expressions.

     With `-fbranch-probabilities', it reads back the data gathered and
     actually performs the optimizations based on them.  Currently the
     optimizations include specialization of division operation using
     the knowledge about the value of the denominator.

`-frename-registers'
     Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
     of registers left over after register allocation.  This
     optimization will most benefit processors with lots of registers.
     Depending on the debug information format adopted by the target,
     however, it can make debugging impossible, since variables will no
     longer stay in a "home register".

     Enabled by default with `-funroll-loops' and `-fpeel-loops'.

`-ftracer'
     Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This
     transformation simplifies the control flow of the function
     allowing other optimizations to do better job.

     Enabled with `-fprofile-use'.

`-funroll-loops'
     Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at
     compile time or upon entry to the loop.  `-funroll-loops' implies
     `-frerun-cse-after-loop', `-fweb' and `-frename-registers'.  It
     also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of
     loops with small constant number of iterations).  This option
     makes code larger, and may or may not make it run faster.

     Enabled with `-fprofile-use'.

`-funroll-all-loops'
     Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain
     when the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more
     slowly.  `-funroll-all-loops' implies the same options as
     `-funroll-loops'.

`-fpeel-loops'
     Peels the loops for that there is enough information that they do
     not roll much (from profile feedback).  It also turns on complete
     loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant
     number of iterations).

     Enabled with `-fprofile-use'.

`-fmove-loop-invariants'
     Enables the loop invariant motion pass in the RTL loop optimizer.
     Enabled at level `-O1'

`-funswitch-loops'
     Move branches with loop invariant conditions out of the loop, with
     duplicates of the loop on both branches (modified according to
     result of the condition).

`-ffunction-sections'
`-fdata-sections'
     Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
     file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
     function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
     in the output file.

     Use these options on systems where the linker can perform
     optimizations to improve locality of reference in the instruction
     space.  Most systems using the ELF object format and SPARC
     processors running Solaris 2 have linkers with such optimizations.
     AIX may have these optimizations in the future.

     Only use these options when there are significant benefits from
     doing so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and
     linker will create larger object and executable files and will
     also be slower.  You will not be able to use `gprof' on all
     systems if you specify this option and you may have problems with
     debugging if you specify both this option and `-g'.

`-fbranch-target-load-optimize'
     Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue /
     epilogue threading.  The use of target registers can typically be
     exposed only during reload, thus hoisting loads out of loops and
     doing inter-block scheduling needs a separate optimization pass.

`-fbranch-target-load-optimize2'
     Perform branch target register load optimization after prologue /
     epilogue threading.

`-fbtr-bb-exclusive'
     When performing branch target register load optimization, don't
     reuse branch target registers in within any basic block.

`-fstack-protector'
     Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack
     smashing attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to
     functions with vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that
     call alloca, and functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The
     guards are initialized when a function is entered and then checked
     when the function exits.  If a guard check fails, an error message
     is printed and the program exits.

`-fstack-protector-all'
     Like `-fstack-protector' except that all functions are protected.

`-fsection-anchors'
     Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
     shared "anchor" symbols to address nearby objects.  This
     transformation can help to reduce the number of GOT entries and
     GOT accesses on some targets.

     For example, the implementation of the following function `foo':

          static int a, b, c;
          int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }

     would usually calculate the addresses of all three variables, but
     if you compile it with `-fsection-anchors', it will access the
     variables from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is
     similar to the following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):

          int foo (void)
          {
            register int *xr = &x;
            return xr[&a - &x] + xr[&b - &x] + xr[&c - &x];
          }

     Not all targets support this option.

`--param NAME=VALUE'
     In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the amount of
     optimization that is done.  For example, GCC will not inline
     functions that contain more that a certain number of instructions.
     You can control some of these constants on the command-line using
     the `--param' option.

     The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values,
     are tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to
     change without notice in future releases.

     In each case, the VALUE is an integer.  The allowable choices for
     NAME are given in the following table:

    `struct-reorg-cold-struct-ratio'
          The threshold ratio (as a percentage) between a structure
          frequency and the frequency of the hottest structure in the
          program.  This parameter is used by struct-reorg optimization
          enabled by `-fipa-struct-reorg'.  We say that if the ratio of
          a structure frequency, calculated by profiling, to the
          hottest structure frequency in the program is less than this
          parameter, then structure reorganization is not applied to
          this structure.  The default is 10.

    `predictable-branch-outcome'
          When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower
          than this threshold (in percent), then it is considered well
          predictable. The default is 10.

    `max-crossjump-edges'
          The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for
          crossjumping.  The algorithm used by `-fcrossjumping' is
          O(N^2) in the number of edges incoming to each block.
          Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making
          the compile time increase with probably small improvement in
          executable size.

    `min-crossjump-insns'
          The minimum number of instructions which must be matched at
          the end of two blocks before crossjumping will be performed
          on them.  This value is ignored in the case where all
          instructions in the block being crossjumped from are matched.
          The default value is 5.

    `max-grow-copy-bb-insns'
          The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic
          blocks instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a
          jump instruction.  The default value is 8.

    `max-goto-duplication-insns'
          The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block
          that jumps to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a
          number of passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the
          compilation process, and unfactors them as late as possible.
          Only computed jumps at the end of a basic blocks with no more
          than max-goto-duplication-insns are unfactored.  The default
          value is 8.

    `max-delay-slot-insn-search'
          The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking
          for an instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this
          arbitrary number of instructions is searched, the time
          savings from filling the delay slot will be minimal so stop
          searching.  Increasing values mean more aggressive
          optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
          small improvement in executable run time.

    `max-delay-slot-live-search'
          When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of
          instructions to consider when searching for a block with
          valid live register information.  Increasing this arbitrarily
          chosen value means more aggressive optimization, increasing
          the compile time.  This parameter should be removed when the
          delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the control-flow
          graph.

    `max-gcse-memory'
          The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be
          allocated in order to perform the global common subexpression
          elimination optimization.  If more memory than specified is
          required, the optimization will not be done.

    `max-pending-list-length'
          The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will
          allow before flushing the current state and starting over.
          Large functions with few branches or calls can create
          excessively large lists which needlessly consume memory and
          resources.

    `max-inline-insns-single'
          Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc.
          This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted
          in GCC's internal representation) in a single function that
          the tree inliner will consider for inlining.  This only
          affects functions declared inline and methods implemented in
          a class declaration (C++).  The default value is 300.

    `max-inline-insns-auto'
          When you use `-finline-functions' (included in `-O3'), a lot
          of functions that would otherwise not be considered for
          inlining by the compiler will be investigated.  To those
          functions, a different (more restrictive) limit compared to
          functions declared inline can be applied.  The default value
          is 50.

    `large-function-insns'
          The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions
          larger than this limit after inlining, inlining is
          constrained by `--param large-function-growth'.  This
          parameter is useful primarily to avoid extreme compilation
          time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the backend.
          The default value is 2700.

    `large-function-growth'
          Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining
          in percents.  The default value is 100 which limits large
          function growth to 2.0 times the original size.

    `large-unit-insns'
          The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused
          by inlining of units larger than this limit is limited by
          `--param inline-unit-growth'.  For small units this might be
          too tight (consider unit consisting of function A that is
          inline and B that just calls A three time.  If B is small
          relative to A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such
          inlining is very sane.  For very large units consisting of
          small inlineable functions however the overall unit growth
          limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.
          Thus for smaller units, the size is increased to `--param
          large-unit-insns' before applying `--param
          inline-unit-growth'.  The default is 10000

    `inline-unit-growth'
          Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit
          caused by inlining.  The default value is 30 which limits
          unit growth to 1.3 times the original size.

    `ipcp-unit-growth'
          Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit
          caused by interprocedural constant propagation.  The default
          value is 10 which limits unit growth to 1.1 times the
          original size.

    `large-stack-frame'
          The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the
          algorithm is trying to not grow past this limit too much.
          Default value is 256 bytes.

    `large-stack-frame-growth'
          Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by
          inlining in percents.  The default value is 1000 which limits
          large stack frame growth to 11 times the original size.

    `max-inline-insns-recursive'
    `max-inline-insns-recursive-auto'
          Specifies maximum number of instructions out-of-line copy of
          self recursive inline function can grow into by performing
          recursive inlining.

          For functions declared inline `--param
          max-inline-insns-recursive' is taken into account.  For
          function not declared inline, recursive inlining happens only
          when `-finline-functions' (included in `-O3') is enabled and
          `--param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto' is used.  The
          default value is 450.

    `max-inline-recursive-depth'
    `max-inline-recursive-depth-auto'
          Specifies maximum recursion depth used by the recursive
          inlining.

          For functions declared inline `--param
          max-inline-recursive-depth' is taken into account.  For
          function not declared inline, recursive inlining happens only
          when `-finline-functions' (included in `-O3') is enabled and
          `--param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto' is used.  The
          default value is 8.

    `min-inline-recursive-probability'
          Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having
          deep recursion in average and can hurt for function having
          little recursion depth by increasing the prologue size or
          complexity of function body to other optimizers.

          When profile feedback is available (see `-fprofile-generate')
          the actual recursion depth can be guessed from probability
          that function will recurse via given call expression.  This
          parameter limits inlining only to call expression whose
          probability exceeds given threshold (in percents).  The
          default value is 10.

    `early-inlining-insns'
          Specify growth that early inliner can make.  In effect it
          increases amount of inlining for code having large
          abstraction penalty.  The default value is 8.

    `max-early-inliner-iterations'
    `max-early-inliner-iterations'
          Limit of iterations of early inliner.  This basically bounds
          number of nested indirect calls early inliner can resolve.
          Deeper chains are still handled by late inlining.

    `min-vect-loop-bound'
          The minimum number of iterations under which a loop will not
          get vectorized when `-ftree-vectorize' is used.  The number
          of iterations after vectorization needs to be greater than
          the value specified by this option to allow vectorization.
          The default value is 0.

    `max-unrolled-insns'
          The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if
          that loop is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it
          determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.

    `max-average-unrolled-insns'
          The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of
          their execution that a loop should have if that loop is
          unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it determines how many
          times the loop code is unrolled.

    `max-unroll-times'
          The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.

    `max-peeled-insns'
          The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if
          that loop is peeled, and if the loop is peeled, it determines
          how many times the loop code is peeled.

    `max-peel-times'
          The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.

    `max-completely-peeled-insns'
          The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.

          The maximum depth of a loop nest suitable for complete
          peeling.

          invariant motion.

    `iv-consider-all-candidates-bound'
          Bound on number of candidates for induction variables below
          that all candidates are considered for each use in induction
          variable optimizations.  Only the most relevant candidates
          are considered if there are more candidates, to avoid
          quadratic time complexity.

    `iv-max-considered-uses'
          The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that
          contain more induction variable uses.

    `iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound'
          If number of candidates in the set is smaller than this value,
          we always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set during
          its optimization when a new iv is added to the set.

    `scev-max-expr-size'
          Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions
          analyzer.  Large expressions slow the analyzer.

    `omega-max-vars'
          The maximum number of variables in an Omega constraint system.
          The default value is 128.

    `omega-max-geqs'
          The maximum number of inequalities in an Omega constraint
          system.  The default value is 256.

    `omega-max-eqs'
          The maximum number of equalities in an Omega constraint
          system.  The default value is 128.

    `omega-max-wild-cards'

          value is 550.

    `omega-max-keys'
          The maximal number of keys used by the Omega solver.  The
          default value is 500.

    `omega-eliminate-redundant-constraints'
          When set to 1, use expensive methods to eliminate all
          redundant constraints.  The default value is 0.

    `vect-max-version-for-alignment-checks'
          The maximum number of runtime checks that can be performed
          when doing loop versioning for alignment in the vectorizer.
          See option ftree-vect-loop-version for more information.

    `vect-max-version-for-alias-checks'
          The maximum number of runtime checks that can be performed
          when doing loop versioning for alias in the vectorizer.  See

          The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute force
          algorithm for analysis of # of iterations of the loop tries
          to evaluate.

    `hot-bb-count-fraction'
          Select fraction of the maximal count of repetitions of basic
          block in program given basic block needs to have to be
          considered hot.

    `hot-bb-frequency-fraction'
          Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of
          basic block in function given basic block needs to have to be
          considered hot

    `max-predicted-iterations'
          The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.
          This is useful in cases where function contain single loop
          with known bound and other loop with unknown.  We predict the
          known number of iterations correctly, while the unknown
          number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that
          the loop without bounds would appear artificially cold
          relative to the other one.

    `align-threshold'
          Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of
          basic block in function given basic block will get aligned.

    `align-loop-iterations'
          A loop expected to iterate at lest the selected number of
          iterations will get aligned.

    `tracer-dynamic-coverage'
    `tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback'
          This value is used to limit superblock formation once the
          given percentage of executed instructions is covered.  This
          limits unnecessary code size expansion.

          The `tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback' is used only when
          profile feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed
          to statically estimated ones) are much less balanced allowing
          the threshold to be larger value.

    `tracer-max-code-growth'
          Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given
          percentage.  This is rather hokey argument, as most of the
          duplicates will be eliminated later in cross jumping, so it
          may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
          growth.

    `tracer-min-branch-ratio'
          Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge
          is less than this threshold (in percent).

    `tracer-min-branch-ratio'
    `tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback'
          Stop forward growth if the best edge do have probability
          lower than this threshold.

          Similarly to `tracer-dynamic-coverage' two values are
          present, one for compilation for profile feedback and one for
          compilation without.  The value for compilation with profile
          feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in order to
          make tracer effective.

    `max-cse-path-length'
          Maximum number of basic blocks on path that cse considers.
          The default is 10.

    `max-cse-insns'
          The maximum instructions CSE process before flushing. The
          default is 1000.

    `ggc-min-expand'
          GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory
          allocation.  This parameter specifies the minimum percentage
          by which the garbage collector's heap should be allowed to
          expand between collections.  Tuning this may improve
          compilation speed; it has no effect on code generation.

          The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of
          100% when RAM >= 1GB.  If `getrlimit' is available, the
          notion of "RAM" is the smallest of actual RAM and
          `RLIMIT_DATA' or `RLIMIT_AS'.  If GCC is not able to
          calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower bound of
          30% is used.  Setting this parameter and `ggc-min-heapsize'
          to zero causes a full collection to occur at every
          opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
          debugging.

    `ggc-min-heapsize'
          Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins
          bothering to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs
          after the heap expands by `ggc-min-expand'% beyond
          `ggc-min-heapsize'.  Again, tuning this may improve
          compilation speed, and has no effect on code generation.

          The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit
          which tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not
          exceeded, but with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and
          an upper bound of 131072 (128 megabytes).  If GCC is not able
          to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower bound is
          used.  Setting this parameter very large effectively disables
          garbage collection.  Setting this parameter and
          `ggc-min-expand' to zero causes a full collection to occur at
          every opportunity.

    `max-reload-search-insns'
          The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward
          for equivalent register.  Increasing values mean more
          aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase
          with probably slightly better performance.  The default value
          is 100.

    `max-cselib-memory-locations'
          The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take
          into account.  Increasing values mean more aggressive
          optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
          slightly better performance.  The default value is 500.

    `reorder-blocks-duplicate'
    `reorder-blocks-duplicate-feedback'
          Used by basic block reordering pass to decide whether to use
          unconditional branch or duplicate the code on its
          destination.  Code is duplicated when its estimated size is
          smaller than this value multiplied by the estimated size of
          unconditional jump in the hot spots of the program.

          The `reorder-block-duplicate-feedback' is used only when
          profile feedback is available and may be set to higher values
          than `reorder-block-duplicate' since information about the
          hot spots is more accurate.

    `max-sched-ready-insns'
          The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the
          scheduler should consider at any given time during the first
          scheduling pass.  Increasing values mean more thorough
          searches, making the compilation time increase with probably
          little benefit.  The default value is 100.

    `max-sched-region-blocks'
          The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for
          interblock scheduling.  The default value is 10.

    `max-pipeline-region-blocks'
          The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for
          pipelining in the selective scheduler.  The default value is
          15.

    `max-sched-region-insns'
          The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
          interblock scheduling.  The default value is 100.

    `max-pipeline-region-insns'
          The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
          pipelining in the selective scheduler.  The default value is
          200.

    `min-spec-prob'
          The minimum probability (in percents) of reaching a source
          block for interblock speculative scheduling.  The default
          value is 40.

    `max-sched-extend-regions-iters'
          The maximum number of iterations through CFG to extend
          regions.  0 - disable region extension, N - do at most N
          iterations.  The default value is 0.

    `max-sched-insn-conflict-delay'
          The maximum conflict delay for an insn to be considered for
          speculative motion.  The default value is 3.

    `sched-spec-prob-cutoff'
          The minimal probability of speculation success (in percents),
          so that speculative insn will be scheduled.  The default
          value is 40.

    `sched-mem-true-dep-cost'
          Minimal distance (in CPU cycles) between store and load
          targeting same memory locations.  The default value is 1.

    `selsched-max-lookahead'
          The maximum size of the lookahead window of selective
          scheduling.  It is a depth of search for available
          instructions.  The default value is 50.

    `selsched-max-sched-times'
          The maximum number of times that an instruction will be
          scheduled during selective scheduling.  This is the limit on
          the number of iterations through which the instruction may be
          pipelined.  The default value is 2.

    `selsched-max-insns-to-rename'
          The maximum number of best instructions in the ready list
          that are considered for renaming in the selective scheduler.
          The default value is 2.

    `max-last-value-rtl'
          The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be
          recorded in an expression in combiner for a pseudo register
          as last known value of that register.  The default is 10000.

    `integer-share-limit'
          Small integer constants can use a shared data structure,
          reducing the compiler's memory usage and increasing its
          speed.  This sets the maximum value of a shared integer
          constant.  The default value is 256.

    `min-virtual-mappings'
          Specifies the minimum number of virtual mappings in the
          incremental SSA updater that should be registered to trigger
          the virtual mappings heuristic defined by
          virtual-mappings-ratio.  The default value is 100.

    `virtual-mappings-ratio'
          If the number of virtual mappings is virtual-mappings-ratio
          bigger than the number of virtual symbols to be updated, then
          the incremental SSA updater switches to a full update for
          those symbols.  The default ratio is 3.

    `ssp-buffer-size'
          The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that will receive
          stack smashing protection when `-fstack-protection' is used.

    `max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts'
          Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that needs to
          be duplicated when threading jumps.

    `max-fields-for-field-sensitive'
          Maximum number of fields in a structure we will treat in a
          field sensitive manner during pointer analysis.  The default
          is zero for -O0, and -O1 and 100 for -Os, -O2, and -O3.

    `prefetch-latency'
          Estimate on average number of instructions that are executed
          before prefetch finishes.  The distance we prefetch ahead is
          proportional to this constant.  Increasing this number may
          also lead to less streams being prefetched (see
          `simultaneous-prefetches').

    `simultaneous-prefetches'
          Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same time.

    `l1-cache-line-size'
          The size of cache line in L1 cache, in bytes.

    `l1-cache-size'
          The size of L1 cache, in kilobytes.

    `l2-cache-size'
          The size of L2 cache, in kilobytes.

    `min-insn-to-prefetch-ratio'
          The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
          number of prefetches to enable prefetching in a loop with an
          unknown trip count.

    `prefetch-min-insn-to-mem-ratio'
          The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
          number of memory references to enable prefetching in a loop.

    `use-canonical-types'
          Whether the compiler should use the "canonical" type system.
          By default, this should always be 1, which uses a more
          efficient internal mechanism for comparing types in C++ and
          Objective-C++.  However, if bugs in the canonical type system
          are causing compilation failures, set this value to 0 to
          disable canonical types.

    `switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio'
          Switch initialization conversion will refuse to create arrays
          that are bigger than `switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio'
          times the number of branches in the switch.

    `max-partial-antic-length'
          Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the
          tree partial redundancy elimination optimization
          (`-ftree-pre') when optimizing at `-O3' and above.  For some
          sorts of source code the enhanced partial redundancy
          elimination optimization can run away, consuming all of the
          memory available on the host machine.  This parameter sets a
          limit on the length of the sets that are computed, which
          prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for this
          parameter will allow an unlimited set length.

    `sccvn-max-scc-size'
          Maximum size of a strongly connected component (SCC) during
          SCCVN processing.  If this limit is hit, SCCVN processing for
          the whole function will not be done and optimizations
          depending on it will be disabled.  The default maximum SCC
          size is 10000.

    `ira-max-loops-num'
          IRA uses a regional register allocation by default.  If a
          function contains loops more than number given by the
          parameter, only at most given number of the most frequently
          executed loops will form regions for the regional register
          allocation.  The default value of the parameter is 100.

    `ira-max-conflict-table-size'
          Although IRA uses a sophisticated algorithm of compression
          conflict table, the table can be still big for huge
          functions.  If the conflict table for a function could be
          more than size in MB given by the parameter, the conflict
          table is not built and faster, simpler, and lower quality
          register allocation algorithm will be used.  The algorithm do
          not use pseudo-register conflicts.  The default value of the
          parameter is 2000.

    `ira-loop-reserved-regs'
          IRA can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure
          in loops for decision to move loop invariants (see `-O3').
          The number of available registers reserved for some other
          purposes is described by this parameter.  The default value
          of the parameter is 2 which is minimal number of registers
          needed for execution of typical instruction.  This value is
          the best found from numerous experiments.

    `loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop'
          Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in compile
          time and in amount of needed compile time memory, with very
          large loops.  Loops with more basic blocks than this
          parameter won't have loop invariant motion optimization
          performed on them.  The default value of the parameter is
          1000 for -O1 and 10000 for -O2 and above.

    `max-vartrack-size'
          Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during
          variable tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If this
          limit is exceeded with variable tracking at assignments
          enabled, analysis for that function is retried without it,
          after removing all debug insns from the function.  If the
          limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var tracking
          analysis is completely disabled for the function.  Setting
          the parameter to zero makes it unlimited.

    `min-nondebug-insn-uid'
          Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns.  The
          range below the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug
          insns created by `-fvar-tracking-assignments', but debug
          insns may get (non-overlapping) uids above it if the reserved
          range is exhausted.

    `ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor'
          IPA-SRA will replace a pointer to an aggregate with one or
          more new parameters only when their cumulative size is less
          or equal to `ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor' times the size of the
          original pointer parameter.

    `graphite-max-nb-scop-params'
          To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop transforms,
          the number of parameters in a Static Control Part (SCoP) is
          bounded.  The default value is 10 parameters.  A variable
          whose value is unknown at compile time and defined outside a
          SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.

    `graphite-max-bbs-per-function'
          To avoid exponential effects in the detection of SCoPs, the
          size of the functions analyzed by Graphite is bounded.  The
          default value is 100 basic blocks.

    `loop-block-tile-size'
          Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
          `-floop-block' or `-floop-strip-mine', strip mine each loop
          in the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The strip
          length can be changed using the `loop-block-tile-size'
          parameter.  The default value is 51 iterations.

3.11 Options Controlling the Preprocessor
=========================================

These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.

 If you use the `-E' option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with `-E' because they
cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual compilation.

`-Wp,OPTION'
     You can use `-Wp,OPTION' to bypass the compiler driver and pass
     OPTION directly through to the preprocessor.  If OPTION contains
     commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  However,
     many options are modified, translated or interpreted by the
     compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and `-Wp'
     forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct interface
     is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible you
     should avoid using `-Wp' and let the driver handle the options
     instead.

`-Xpreprocessor OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to
     supply system-specific preprocessor options which GCC does not
     know how to recognize.

     If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
     `-Xpreprocessor' twice, once for the option and once for the
     argument.

`-D NAME'
     Predefine NAME as a macro, with definition `1'.

`-D NAME=DEFINITION'
     The contents of DEFINITION are tokenized and processed as if they
     appeared during translation phase three in a `#define' directive.
     In particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded
     newline characters.

     If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
     program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
     characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.

     If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line,
     write its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the
     equals sign (if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells,
     so you will need to quote the option.  With `sh' and `csh',
     `-D'NAME(ARGS...)=DEFINITION'' works.

     `-D' and `-U' options are processed in the order they are given on
     the command line.  All `-imacros FILE' and `-include FILE' options
     are processed after all `-D' and `-U' options.

`-U NAME'
     Cancel any previous definition of NAME, either built in or
     provided with a `-D' option.

`-undef'
     Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
     standard predefined macros remain defined.

`-I DIR'
     Add the directory DIR to the list of directories to be searched
     for header files.  Directories named by `-I' are searched before
     the standard system include directories.  If the directory DIR is
     a standard system include directory, the option is ignored to
     ensure that the default search order for system directories and
     the special treatment of system headers are not defeated .  If DIR
     begins with `=', then the `=' will be replaced by the sysroot
     prefix; see `--sysroot' and `-isysroot'.

`-o FILE'
     Write output to FILE.  This is the same as specifying FILE as the
     second non-option argument to `cpp'.  `gcc' has a different
     interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must use
     `-o' to specify the output file.

`-Wall'
     Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
     At present this is `-Wcomment', `-Wtrigraphs', `-Wmultichar' and a
     warning about integer promotion causing a change of sign in `#if'
     expressions.  Note that many of the preprocessor's warnings are on
     by default and have no options to control them.

`-Wcomment'
`-Wcomments'
     Warn whenever a comment-start sequence `/*' appears in a `/*'
     comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a `//' comment.
     (Both forms have the same effect.)

`-Wtrigraphs'
     Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the
     program.  However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline
     (`??/' at the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment
     begins or ends.  Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped
     newlines produce warnings inside a comment.

     This option is implied by `-Wall'.  If `-Wall' is not given, this
     option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To get
     trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other `-Wall'
     warnings, use `-trigraphs -Wall -Wno-trigraphs'.

`-Wtraditional'
     Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
     traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have
     no traditional C equivalent, and problematic constructs which
     should be avoided.

`-Wundef'
     Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in
     an `#if' directive, outside of `defined'.  Such identifiers are
     replaced with zero.

`-Wunused-macros'
     Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A
     macro is "used" if it is expanded or tested for existence at least
     once.  The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been
     used at the time it is redefined or undefined.

     Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
     defined in include files are not warned about.

     _Note:_ If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
     conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as unused.  To avoid
     the warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the
     macro's definition by, for example, moving it into the first
     skipped block.  Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with
     something like:

          #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
          #endif

`-Wendif-labels'
     Warn whenever an `#else' or an `#endif' are followed by text.
     This usually happens in code of the form

          #if FOO
          ...
          #else FOO
          ...
          #endif FOO

     The second and third `FOO' should be in comments, but often are not
     in older programs.  This warning is on by default.

`-Werror'
     Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers
     warnings will be rejected.

`-Wsystem-headers'
     Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally
     unhelpful in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.
     If you are responsible for the system library, you may want to see
     them.

`-w'
     Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP issues by
     default.

`-pedantic'
     Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.
     Some of them are left out by default, since they trigger
     frequently on harmless code.

`-pedantic-errors'
     Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory
     diagnostics into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that
     GCC issues without `-pedantic' but treats as warnings.

`-M'
     Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
     suitable for `make' describing the dependencies of the main source
     file.  The preprocessor outputs one `make' rule containing the
     object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of
     all the included files, including those coming from `-include' or
     `-imacros' command line options.

     Unless specified explicitly (with `-MT' or `-MQ'), the object file
     name consists of the name of the source file with any suffix
     replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
     parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
     split into several lines using `\'-newline.  The rule has no
     commands.

     This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output,
     such as `-dM'.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the
     dependency rules you should explicitly specify the dependency
     output file with `-MF', or use an environment variable like
     `DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' (*note Environment Variables::).  Debug
     output will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.

     Passing `-M' to the driver implies `-E', and suppresses warnings
     with an implicit `-w'.

`-MM'
     Like `-M' but do not mention header files that are found in system
     header directories, nor header files that are included, directly
     or indirectly, from such a header.

     This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in
     an `#include' directive does not in itself determine whether that
     header will appear in `-MM' dependency output.  This is a slight
     change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.

`-MF FILE'
     When used with `-M' or `-MM', specifies a file to write the
     dependencies to.  If no `-MF' switch is given the preprocessor
     sends the rules to the same place it would have sent preprocessed
     output.

     When used with the driver options `-MD' or `-MMD', `-MF' overrides
     the default dependency output file.

`-MG'
     In conjunction with an option such as `-M' requesting dependency
     generation, `-MG' assumes missing header files are generated files
     and adds them to the dependency list without raising an error.
     The dependency filename is taken directly from the `#include'
     directive without prepending any path.  `-MG' also suppresses
     preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders this useless.

     This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.

`-MP'
     This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency
     other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
     dummy rules work around errors `make' gives if you remove header
     files without updating the `Makefile' to match.

     This is typical output:

          test.o: test.c test.h

          test.h:

`-MT TARGET'
     Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
     default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
     directory components and any file suffix such as `.c', and appends
     the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.

     An `-MT' option will set the target to be exactly the string you
     specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a
     single argument to `-MT', or use multiple `-MT' options.

     For example, `-MT '$(objpfx)foo.o'' might give

          $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

`-MQ TARGET'
     Same as `-MT', but it quotes any characters which are special to
     Make.  `-MQ '$(objpfx)foo.o'' gives

          $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

     The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given
     with `-MQ'.

`-MD'
     `-MD' is equivalent to `-M -MF FILE', except that `-E' is not
     implied.  The driver determines FILE based on whether an `-o'
     option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its argument but with
     a suffix of `.d', otherwise it takes the name of the input file,
     removes any directory components and suffix, and applies a `.d'
     suffix.

     If `-MD' is used in conjunction with `-E', any `-o' switch is
     understood to specify the dependency output file (*note -MF:
     dashMF.), but if used without `-E', each `-o' is understood to
     specify a target object file.

     Since `-E' is not implied, `-MD' can be used to generate a
     dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.

`-MMD'
     Like `-MD' except mention only user header files, not system
     header files.

`-fpch-deps'
     When using precompiled headers (*note Precompiled Headers::), this
     flag will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the files
     from the precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only
     the precompiled header would be listed and not the files that were
     used to create it because those files are not consulted when a
     precompiled header is used.

`-fpch-preprocess'
     This option allows use of a precompiled header (*note Precompiled
     Headers::) together with `-E'.  It inserts a special `#pragma',
     `#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "<filename>"' in the output to mark
     the place where the precompiled header was found, and its
     filename.  When `-fpreprocessed' is in use, GCC recognizes this
     `#pragma' and loads the PCH.

     This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed
     output is only really suitable as input to GCC.  It is switched on
     by `-save-temps'.

     You should not write this `#pragma' in your own code, but it is
     safe to edit the filename if the PCH file is available in a
     different location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be
     relative to GCC's current directory.

`-x c'
`-x c++'
`-x objective-c'
`-x assembler-with-cpp'
     Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or assembly.
     This has nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions;
     it merely selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none
     of these options, cpp will deduce the language from the extension
     of the source file: `.c', `.cc', `.m', or `.S'.  Some other common
     extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does
     not recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is
     the most generic mode.

     _Note:_ Previous versions of cpp accepted a `-lang' option which
     selected both the language and the standards conformance level.
     This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the `-l'
     option.

`-std=STANDARD'
`-ansi'
     Specify the standard to which the code should conform.  Currently
     CPP knows about C and C++ standards; others may be added in the
     future.

     STANDARD may be one of:
    `c90'
    `c89'
    `iso9899:1990'
          The ISO C standard from 1990.  `c90' is the customary
          shorthand for this version of the standard.

          The `-ansi' option is equivalent to `-std=c90'.

    `iso9899:199409'
          The 1990 C standard, as amended in 1994.

    `iso9899:1999'
    `c99'
    `iso9899:199x'
    `c9x'
          The revised ISO C standard, published in December 1999.
          Before publication, this was known as C9X.

    `gnu90'
    `gnu89'
          The 1990 C standard plus GNU extensions.  This is the default.

    `gnu99'
    `gnu9x'
          The 1999 C standard plus GNU extensions.

    `c++98'
          The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.

    `gnu++98'
          The same as `-std=c++98' plus GNU extensions.  This is the
          default for C++ code.

`-I-'
     Split the include path.  Any directories specified with `-I'
     options before `-I-' are searched only for headers requested with
     `#include "FILE"'; they are not searched for `#include <FILE>'.
     If additional directories are specified with `-I' options after
     the `-I-', those directories are searched for all `#include'
     directives.

     In addition, `-I-' inhibits the use of the directory of the current
     file directory as the first search directory for `#include "FILE"'.
     This option has been deprecated.

`-nostdinc'
     Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
     Only the directories you have specified with `-I' options (and the
     directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.

`-nostdinc++'
     Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard
     directories, but do still search the other standard directories.
     (This option is used when building the C++ library.)

`-include FILE'
     Process FILE as if `#include "file"' appeared as the first line of
     the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched
     for FILE is the preprocessor's working directory _instead of_ the
     directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it
     is searched for in the remainder of the `#include "..."' search
     chain as normal.

     If multiple `-include' options are given, the files are included
     in the order they appear on the command line.

`-imacros FILE'
     Exactly like `-include', except that any output produced by
     scanning FILE is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain defined.
     This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without
     also processing its declarations.

     All files specified by `-imacros' are processed before all files
     specified by `-include'.

`-idirafter DIR'
     Search DIR for header files, but do it _after_ all directories
     specified with `-I' and the standard system directories have been
     exhausted.  DIR is treated as a system include directory.  If DIR
     begins with `=', then the `=' will be replaced by the sysroot
     prefix; see `--sysroot' and `-isysroot'.

`-iprefix PREFIX'
     Specify PREFIX as the prefix for subsequent `-iwithprefix'
     options.  If the prefix represents a directory, you should include
     the final `/'.

`-iwithprefix DIR'
`-iwithprefixbefore DIR'
     Append DIR to the prefix specified previously with `-iprefix', and
     add the resulting directory to the include search path.
     `-iwithprefixbefore' puts it in the same place `-I' would;
     `-iwithprefix' puts it where `-idirafter' would.

`-isysroot DIR'
     This option is like the `--sysroot' option, but applies only to
     header files.  See the `--sysroot' option for more information.

`-imultilib DIR'
     Use DIR as a subdirectory of the directory containing
     target-specific C++ headers.

`-isystem DIR'
     Search DIR for header files, after all directories specified by
     `-I' but before the standard system directories.  Mark it as a
     system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as is
     applied to the standard system directories.  If DIR begins with
     `=', then the `=' will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
     `--sysroot' and `-isysroot'.

`-iquote DIR'
     Search DIR only for header files requested with `#include "FILE"';
     they are not searched for `#include <FILE>', before all
     directories specified by `-I' and before the standard system
     directories.  If DIR begins with `=', then the `=' will be replaced
     by the sysroot prefix; see `--sysroot' and `-isysroot'.

`-fdirectives-only'
     When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.

     The option's behavior depends on the `-E' and `-fpreprocessed'
     options.

     With `-E', preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
     such as `#define', `#ifdef', and `#error'.  Other preprocessor
     operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph conversion are
     not performed.  In addition, the `-dD' option is implicitly
     enabled.

     With `-fpreprocessed', predefinition of command line and most
     builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as `__LINE__', which are
     contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables
     compilation of files previously preprocessed with `-E
     -fdirectives-only'.

     With both `-E' and `-fpreprocessed', the rules for
     `-fpreprocessed' take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing
     of files previously preprocessed with `-E -fdirectives-only'.

`-fdollars-in-identifiers'
     Accept `$' in identifiers.

`-fextended-identifiers'
     Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is
     experimental; in a future version of GCC, it will be enabled by
     default for C99 and C++.

`-fpreprocessed'
     Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
     preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion,
     trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of
     most directives.  The preprocessor still recognizes and removes
     comments, so that you can pass a file preprocessed with `-C' to
     the compiler without problems.  In this mode the integrated
     preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.

     `-fpreprocessed' is implicit if the input file has one of the
     extensions `.i', `.ii' or `.mi'.  These are the extensions that
     GCC uses for preprocessed files created by `-save-temps'.

`-ftabstop=WIDTH'
     Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor
     report correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs
     appear on the line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than
     100, the option is ignored.  The default is 8.

`-fexec-charset=CHARSET'
     Set the execution character set, used for string and character
     constants.  The default is UTF-8.  CHARSET can be any encoding
     supported by the system's `iconv' library routine.

`-fwide-exec-charset=CHARSET'
     Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and
     character constants.  The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever
     corresponds to the width of `wchar_t'.  As with `-fexec-charset',
     CHARSET can be any encoding supported by the system's `iconv'
     library routine; however, you will have problems with encodings
     that do not fit exactly in `wchar_t'.

`-finput-charset=CHARSET'
     Set the input character set, used for translation from the
     character set of the input file to the source character set used
     by GCC.  If the locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this
     information from the locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be
     overridden by either the locale or this command line option.
     Currently the command line option takes precedence if there's a
     conflict.  CHARSET can be any encoding supported by the system's
     `iconv' library routine.

`-fworking-directory'
     Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that
     will let the compiler know the current working directory at the
     time of preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the
     preprocessor will emit, after the initial linemarker, a second
     linemarker with the current working directory followed by two
     slashes.  GCC will use this directory, when it's present in the
     preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current
     working directory in some debugging information formats.  This
     option is implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled,
     but this can be inhibited with the negated form
     `-fno-working-directory'.  If the `-P' flag is present in the
     command line, this option has no effect, since no `#line'
     directives are emitted whatsoever.

`-fno-show-column'
     Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary
     if diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not
     understand the column numbers, such as `dejagnu'.

`-A PREDICATE=ANSWER'
     Make an assertion with the predicate PREDICATE and answer ANSWER.
     This form is preferred to the older form `-A PREDICATE(ANSWER)',
     which is still supported, because it does not use shell special
     characters.

`-A -PREDICATE=ANSWER'
     Cancel an assertion with the predicate PREDICATE and answer ANSWER.

`-dCHARS'
     CHARS is a sequence of one or more of the following characters,
     and must not be preceded by a space.  Other characters are
     interpreted by the compiler proper, or reserved for future
     versions of GCC, and so are silently ignored.  If you specify
     characters whose behavior conflicts, the result is undefined.

    `M'
          Instead of the normal output, generate a list of `#define'
          directives for all the macros defined during the execution of
          the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives
          you a way of finding out what is predefined in your version
          of the preprocessor.  Assuming you have no file `foo.h', the
          command

               touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h

          will show all the predefined macros.

          If you use `-dM' without the `-E' option, `-dM' is
          interpreted as a synonym for `-fdump-rtl-mach'.  *Note
          Debugging Options: (gcc)Debugging Options.

    `D'
          Like `M' except in two respects: it does _not_ include the
          predefined macros, and it outputs _both_ the `#define'
          directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of
          output go to the standard output file.

    `N'
          Like `D', but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.

    `I'
          Output `#include' directives in addition to the result of
          preprocessing.

    `U'
          Like `D' except that only macros that are expanded, or whose
          definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output;
          the output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and
          `#undef' directives are also output for macros tested but
          undefined at the time.

`-P'
     Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the
     preprocessor.  This might be useful when running the preprocessor
     on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program
     which might be confused by the linemarkers.

`-C'
     Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the
     output file, except for comments in processed directives, which
     are deleted along with the directive.

     You should be prepared for side effects when using `-C'; it causes
     the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
     For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
     directive line have the effect of turning that line into an
     ordinary source line, since the first token on the line is no
     longer a `#'.

`-CC'
     Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
     like `-C', except that comments contained within macros are also
     passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.

     In addition to the side-effects of the `-C' option, the `-CC'
     option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be
     converted to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use of
     that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the
     source line.

     The `-CC' option is generally used to support lint comments.

`-traditional-cpp'
     Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C preprocessors, as
     opposed to ISO C preprocessors.

`-trigraphs'
     Process trigraph sequences.  These are three-character sequences,
     all starting with `??', that are defined by ISO C to stand for
     single characters.  For example, `??/' stands for `\', so `'??/n''
     is a character constant for a newline.  By default, GCC ignores
     trigraphs, but in standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See
     the `-std' and `-ansi' options.

     The nine trigraphs and their replacements are

          Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??<  ??>  ??=  ??/  ??'  ??!  ??-
          Replacement:      [    ]    {    }    #    \    ^    |    ~

`-remap'
     Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit
     very short file names, such as MS-DOS.

`--help'
`--target-help'
     Print text describing all the command line options instead of
     preprocessing anything.

`-v'
     Verbose mode.  Print out GNU CPP's version number at the beginning
     of execution, and report the final form of the include path.

`-H'
     Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other
     normal activities.  Each name is indented to show how deep in the
     `#include' stack it is.  Precompiled header files are also
     printed, even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid
     precompiled header file is printed with `...x' and a valid one
     with `...!' .

`-version'
`--version'
     Print out GNU CPP's version number.  With one dash, proceed to
     preprocess as normal.  With two dashes, exit immediately.

3.12 Passing Options to the Assembler
=====================================

You can pass options to the assembler.

`-Wa,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the assembler.  If OPTION contains
     commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.

`-Xassembler OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the assembler.  You can use this to
     supply system-specific assembler options which GCC does not know
     how to recognize.

     If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
     `-Xassembler' twice, once for the option and once for the argument.

3.13 Options for Linking
========================

These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is not
doing a link step.

`OBJECT-FILE-NAME'
     A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
     considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
     distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
     contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as
     input to the linker.

`-c'
`-S'
`-E'
     If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
     object file names should not be used as arguments.  *Note Overall
     Options::.

`-lLIBRARY'
`-l LIBRARY'
     Search the library named LIBRARY when linking.  (The second
     alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
     POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)

     It makes a difference where in the command you write this option;
     the linker searches and processes libraries and object files in
     the order they are specified.  Thus, `foo.o -lz bar.o' searches
     library `z' after file `foo.o' but before `bar.o'.  If `bar.o'
     refers to functions in `z', those functions may not be loaded.

     The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
     which is actually a file named `libLIBRARY.a'.  The linker then
     uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.

     The directories searched include several standard system
     directories plus any that you specify with `-L'.

     Normally the files found this way are library files--archive files
     whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive
     file by scanning through it for members which define symbols that
     have so far been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that
     is found is an ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual
     fashion.  The only difference between using an `-l' option and
     specifying a file name is that `-l' surrounds LIBRARY with `lib'
     and `.a' and searches several directories.

`-lobjc'
     You need this special case of the `-l' option in order to link an
     Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.

`-nostartfiles'
     Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.  The
     standard system libraries are used normally, unless `-nostdlib' or
     `-nodefaultlibs' is used.

`-nodefaultlibs'
     Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.  Only the
     libraries you specify will be passed to the linker, options
     specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
     `-static-libgcc' or `-shared-libgcc', will be ignored.  The
     standard startup files are used normally, unless `-nostartfiles'
     is used.  The compiler may generate calls to `memcmp', `memset',
     `memcpy' and `memmove'.  These entries are usually resolved by
     entries in libc.  These entry points should be supplied through
     some other mechanism when this option is specified.

`-nostdlib'
     Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when
     linking.  No startup files and only the libraries you specify will
     be passed to the linker, options specifying linkage of the system
     libraries, such as `-static-libgcc' or `-shared-libgcc', will be
     ignored.  The compiler may generate calls to `memcmp', `memset',
     `memcpy' and `memmove'.  These entries are usually resolved by
     entries in libc.  These entry points should be supplied through
     some other mechanism when this option is specified.

     One of the standard libraries bypassed by `-nostdlib' and
     `-nodefaultlibs' is `libgcc.a', a library of internal subroutines
     that GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or
     special needs for some languages.  (*Note Interfacing to GCC
     Output: (gccint)Interface, for more discussion of `libgcc.a'.)  In
     most cases, you need `libgcc.a' even when you want to avoid other
     standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify `-nostdlib'
     or `-nodefaultlibs' you should usually specify `-lgcc' as well.
     This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC
     library subroutines.  (For example, `__main', used to ensure C++
     constructors will be called; *note `collect2': (gccint)Collect2.)

`-pie'
     Produce a position independent executable on targets which support
     it.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same set
     of options that were used to generate code (`-fpie', `-fPIE', or
     model suboptions) when you specify this option.

`-rdynamic'
     Pass the flag `-export-dynamic' to the ELF linker, on targets that
     support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not only
     used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed for
     some uses of `dlopen' or to allow obtaining backtraces from within
     a program.

`-s'
     Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the
     executable.

`-static'
     On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking
     with the shared libraries.  On other systems, this option has no
     effect.

`-shared'
     Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other
     objects to form an executable.  Not all systems support this
     option.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same
     set of options that were used to generate code (`-fpic', `-fPIC',
     or model suboptions) when you specify this option.(1)

`-shared-libgcc'
`-static-libgcc'
     On systems that provide `libgcc' as a shared library, these options
     force the use of either the shared or static version respectively.
     If no shared version of `libgcc' was built when the compiler was
     configured, these options have no effect.

     There are several situations in which an application should use the
     shared `libgcc' instead of the static version.  The most common of
     these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
     across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the
     libraries as well as the application itself should use the shared
     `libgcc'.

     Therefore, the G++ and GCJ drivers automatically add
     `-shared-libgcc' whenever you build a shared library or a main
     executable, because C++ and Java programs typically use
     exceptions, so this is the right thing to do.

     If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared libraries,
     you may find that they will not always be linked with the shared
     `libgcc'.  If GCC finds, at its configuration time, that you have
     a non-GNU linker or a GNU linker that does not support option
     `--eh-frame-hdr', it will link the shared version of `libgcc' into
     shared libraries by default.  Otherwise, it will take advantage of
     the linker and optimize away the linking with the shared version
     of `libgcc', linking with the static version of libgcc by default.
     This allows exceptions to propagate through such shared libraries,
     without incurring relocation costs at library load time.

     However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or
     catch exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or GCJ driver, as
     appropriate for the languages used in the program, or using the
     option `-shared-libgcc', such that it is linked with the shared
     `libgcc'.

`-static-libstdc++'
     When the `g++' program is used to link a C++ program, it will
     normally automatically link against `libstdc++'.  If `libstdc++'
     is available as a shared library, and the `-static' option is not
     used, then this will link against the shared version of
     `libstdc++'.  That is normally fine.  However, it is sometimes
     useful to freeze the version of `libstdc++' used by the program
     without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
     `-static-libstdc++' option directs the `g++' driver to link
     `libstdc++' statically, without necessarily linking other
     libraries statically.

`-symbolic'
     Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.
     Warn about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the
     link editor option `-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs').  Only a few
     systems support this option.

`-T SCRIPT'
     Use SCRIPT as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
     systems using the GNU linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
     targets without an operating system, the `-T' option may be
     required when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.

`-Xlinker OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
     supply system-specific linker options which GCC does not know how
     to recognize.

     If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you
     must use `-Xlinker' twice, once for the option and once for the
     argument.  For example, to pass `-assert definitions', you must
     write `-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions'.  It does not work
     to write `-Xlinker "-assert definitions"', because this passes the
     entire string as a single argument, which is not what the linker
     expects.

     When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
     arguments to linker options using the `OPTION=VALUE' syntax than
     as separate arguments.  For example, you can specify `-Xlinker
     -Map=output.map' rather than `-Xlinker -Map -Xlinker output.map'.
     Other linkers may not support this syntax for command-line options.

`-Wl,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the linker.  If OPTION contains
     commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can
     use this syntax to pass an argument to the option.  For example,
     `-Wl,-Map,output.map' passes `-Map output.map' to the linker.
     When using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with
     `-Wl,-Map=output.map'.

`-u SYMBOL'
     Pretend the symbol SYMBOL is undefined, to force linking of
     library modules to define it.  You can use `-u' multiple times with
     different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.

 ---------- Footnotes ----------

 (1) On some systems, `gcc -shared' needs to build supplementary stub
code for constructors to work.  On multi-libbed systems, `gcc -shared'
must select the correct support libraries to link against.  Failing to
supply the correct flags may lead to subtle defects.  Supplying them in
cases where they are not necessary is innocuous.

3.14 Options for Directory Search
=================================

These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:

`-IDIR'
     Add the directory DIR to the head of the list of directories to be
     searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system
     header file, substituting your own version, since these
     directories are searched before the system header file
     directories.  However, you should not use this option to add
     directories that contain vendor-supplied system header files (use
     `-isystem' for that).  If you use more than one `-I' option, the
     directories are scanned in left-to-right order; the standard
     system directories come after.

     If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified
     with `-isystem', is also specified with `-I', the `-I' option will
     be ignored.  The directory will still be searched but as a system
     directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
     This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy system headers
     and the ordering for the include_next directive are not
     inadvertently changed.  If you really need to change the search
     order for system directories, use the `-nostdinc' and/or
     `-isystem' options.

`-iquoteDIR'
     Add the directory DIR to the head of the list of directories to be
     searched for header files only for the case of `#include "FILE"';
     they are not searched for `#include <FILE>', otherwise just like
     `-I'.

`-LDIR'
     Add directory DIR to the list of directories to be searched for
     `-l'.

`-BPREFIX'
     This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
     include files, and data files of the compiler itself.

     The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
     `cpp', `cc1', `as' and `ld'.  It tries PREFIX as a prefix for each
     program it tries to run, both with and without `MACHINE/VERSION/'
     (*note Target Options::).

     For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
     `-B' prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if `-B' was
     not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
     `/usr/lib/gcc/' and `/usr/local/lib/gcc/'.  If neither of those
     results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program name
     is searched for using the directories specified in your `PATH'
     environment variable.

     The compiler will check to see if the path provided by the `-B'
     refers to a directory, and if necessary it will add a directory
     separator character at the end of the path.

     `-B' prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
     to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
     options into `-L' options for the linker.  They also apply to
     includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler
     translates these options into `-isystem' options for the
     preprocessor.  In this case, the compiler appends `include' to the
     prefix.

     The run-time support file `libgcc.a' can also be searched for using
     the `-B' prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
     standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is
     left out of the link if it is not found by those means.

     Another way to specify a prefix much like the `-B' prefix is to use
     the environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.  *Note Environment
     Variables::.

     As a special kludge, if the path provided by `-B' is
     `[dir/]stageN/', where N is a number in the range 0 to 9, then it
     will be replaced by `[dir/]include'.  This is to help with
     boot-strapping the compiler.

`-specs=FILE'
     Process FILE after the compiler reads in the standard `specs'
     file, in order to override the defaults that the `gcc' driver
     program uses when determining what switches to pass to `cc1',
     `cc1plus', `as', `ld', etc.  More than one `-specs=FILE' can be
     specified on the command line, and they are processed in order,
     from left to right.

`--sysroot=DIR'
     Use DIR as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
     For example, if the compiler would normally search for headers in
     `/usr/include' and libraries in `/usr/lib', it will instead search
     `DIR/usr/include' and `DIR/usr/lib'.

     If you use both this option and the `-isysroot' option, then the
     `--sysroot' option will apply to libraries, but the `-isysroot'
     option will apply to header files.

     The GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary
     support for this option.  If your linker does not support this
     option, the header file aspect of `--sysroot' will still work, but
     the library aspect will not.

`-I-'
     This option has been deprecated.  Please use `-iquote' instead for
     `-I' directories before the `-I-' and remove the `-I-'.  Any
     directories you specify with `-I' options before the `-I-' option
     are searched only for the case of `#include "FILE"'; they are not
     searched for `#include <FILE>'.

     If additional directories are specified with `-I' options after
     the `-I-', these directories are searched for all `#include'
     directives.  (Ordinarily _all_ `-I' directories are used this way.)

     In addition, the `-I-' option inhibits the use of the current
     directory (where the current input file came from) as the first
     search directory for `#include "FILE"'.  There is no way to
     override this effect of `-I-'.  With `-I.' you can specify
     searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
     invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor
     does by default, but it is often satisfactory.

     `-I-' does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
     for header files.  Thus, `-I-' and `-nostdinc' are independent.

3.15 Specifying subprocesses and the switches to pass to them
=============================================================

`gcc' is a driver program.  It performs its job by invoking a sequence
of other programs to do the work of compiling, assembling and linking.
GCC interprets its command-line parameters and uses these to deduce
which programs it should invoke, and which command-line options it
ought to place on their command lines.  This behavior is controlled by
"spec strings".  In most cases there is one spec string for each
program that GCC can invoke, but a few programs have multiple spec
strings to control their behavior.  The spec strings built into GCC can
be overridden by using the `-specs=' command-line switch to specify a
spec file.

 "Spec files" are plaintext files that are used to construct spec
strings.  They consist of a sequence of directives separated by blank
lines.  The type of directive is determined by the first non-whitespace
character on the line and it can be one of the following:

`%COMMAND'
     Issues a COMMAND to the spec file processor.  The commands that can
     appear here are:

    `%include <FILE>'
          Search for FILE and insert its text at the current point in
          the specs file.

    `%include_noerr <FILE>'
          Just like `%include', but do not generate an error message if
          the include file cannot be found.

    `%rename OLD_NAME NEW_NAME'
          Rename the spec string OLD_NAME to NEW_NAME.


`*[SPEC_NAME]:'
     This tells the compiler to create, override or delete the named
     spec string.  All lines after this directive up to the next
     directive or blank line are considered to be the text for the spec
     string.  If this results in an empty string then the spec will be
     deleted.  (Or, if the spec did not exist, then nothing will
     happened.)  Otherwise, if the spec does not currently exist a new
     spec will be created.  If the spec does exist then its contents
     will be overridden by the text of this directive, unless the first
     character of that text is the `+' character, in which case the
     text will be appended to the spec.

`[SUFFIX]:'
     Creates a new `[SUFFIX] spec' pair.  All lines after this directive
     and up to the next directive or blank line are considered to make
     up the spec string for the indicated suffix.  When the compiler
     encounters an input file with the named suffix, it will processes
     the spec string in order to work out how to compile that file.
     For example:

          .ZZ:
          z-compile -input %i

     This says that any input file whose name ends in `.ZZ' should be
     passed to the program `z-compile', which should be invoked with the
     command-line switch `-input' and with the result of performing the
     `%i' substitution.  (See below.)

     As an alternative to providing a spec string, the text that
     follows a suffix directive can be one of the following:

    `@LANGUAGE'
          This says that the suffix is an alias for a known LANGUAGE.
          This is similar to using the `-x' command-line switch to GCC
          to specify a language explicitly.  For example:

               .ZZ:
               @c++

          Says that .ZZ files are, in fact, C++ source files.

    `#NAME'
          This causes an error messages saying:

               NAME compiler not installed on this system.

     GCC already has an extensive list of suffixes built into it.  This
     directive will add an entry to the end of the list of suffixes, but
     since the list is searched from the end backwards, it is
     effectively possible to override earlier entries using this
     technique.


 GCC has the following spec strings built into it.  Spec files can
override these strings or create their own.  Note that individual
targets can also add their own spec strings to this list.

     asm          Options to pass to the assembler
     asm_final    Options to pass to the assembler post-processor
     cpp          Options to pass to the C preprocessor
     cc1          Options to pass to the C compiler
     cc1plus      Options to pass to the C++ compiler
     endfile      Object files to include at the end of the link
     link         Options to pass to the linker
     lib          Libraries to include on the command line to the linker
     libgcc       Decides which GCC support library to pass to the linker
     linker       Sets the name of the linker
     predefines   Defines to be passed to the C preprocessor
     signed_char  Defines to pass to CPP to say whether `char' is signed
                  by default
     startfile    Object files to include at the start of the link

 Here is a small example of a spec file:

     %rename lib                 old_lib

     *lib:
     --start-group -lgcc -lc -leval1 --end-group %(old_lib)

 This example renames the spec called `lib' to `old_lib' and then
overrides the previous definition of `lib' with a new one.  The new
definition adds in some extra command-line options before including the
text of the old definition.

 "Spec strings" are a list of command-line options to be passed to their
corresponding program.  In addition, the spec strings can contain
`%'-prefixed sequences to substitute variable text or to conditionally
insert text into the command line.  Using these constructs it is
possible to generate quite complex command lines.

 Here is a table of all defined `%'-sequences for spec strings.  Note
that spaces are not generated automatically around the results of
expanding these sequences.  Therefore you can concatenate them together
or combine them with constant text in a single argument.

`%%'
     Substitute one `%' into the program name or argument.

`%i'
     Substitute the name of the input file being processed.

`%b'
     Substitute the basename of the input file being processed.  This
     is the substring up to (and not including) the last period and not
     including the directory.

`%B'
     This is the same as `%b', but include the file suffix (text after
     the last period).

`%d'
     Marks the argument containing or following the `%d' as a temporary
     file name, so that that file will be deleted if GCC exits
     successfully.  Unlike `%g', this contributes no text to the
     argument.

`%gSUFFIX'
     Substitute a file name that has suffix SUFFIX and is chosen once
     per compilation, and mark the argument in the same way as `%d'.
     To reduce exposure to denial-of-service attacks, the file name is
     now chosen in a way that is hard to predict even when previously
     chosen file names are known.  For example, `%g.s ... %g.o ... %g.s'
     might turn into `ccUVUUAU.s ccXYAXZ12.o ccUVUUAU.s'.  SUFFIX
     matches the regexp `[.A-Za-z]*' or the special string `%O', which
     is treated exactly as if `%O' had been preprocessed.  Previously,
     `%g' was simply substituted with a file name chosen once per
     compilation, without regard to any appended suffix (which was
     therefore treated just like ordinary text), making such attacks
     more likely to succeed.

`%uSUFFIX'
     Like `%g', but generates a new temporary file name even if
     `%uSUFFIX' was already seen.

`%USUFFIX'
     Substitutes the last file name generated with `%uSUFFIX',
     generating a new one if there is no such last file name.  In the
     absence of any `%uSUFFIX', this is just like `%gSUFFIX', except
     they don't share the same suffix _space_, so `%g.s ... %U.s ...
     %g.s ... %U.s' would involve the generation of two distinct file
     names, one for each `%g.s' and another for each `%U.s'.
     Previously, `%U' was simply substituted with a file name chosen
     for the previous `%u', without regard to any appended suffix.

`%jSUFFIX'
     Substitutes the name of the `HOST_BIT_BUCKET', if any, and if it is
     writable, and if save-temps is off; otherwise, substitute the name
     of a temporary file, just like `%u'.  This temporary file is not
     meant for communication between processes, but rather as a junk
     disposal mechanism.

`%|SUFFIX'
`%mSUFFIX'
     Like `%g', except if `-pipe' is in effect.  In that case `%|'
     substitutes a single dash and `%m' substitutes nothing at all.
     These are the two most common ways to instruct a program that it
     should read from standard input or write to standard output.  If
     you need something more elaborate you can use an `%{pipe:`X'}'
     construct: see for example `f/lang-specs.h'.

`%.SUFFIX'
     Substitutes .SUFFIX for the suffixes of a matched switch's args
     when it is subsequently output with `%*'.  SUFFIX is terminated by
     the next space or %.

`%w'
     Marks the argument containing or following the `%w' as the
     designated output file of this compilation.  This puts the argument
     into the sequence of arguments that `%o' will substitute later.

`%o'
     Substitutes the names of all the output files, with spaces
     automatically placed around them.  You should write spaces around
     the `%o' as well or the results are undefined.  `%o' is for use in
     the specs for running the linker.  Input files whose names have no
     recognized suffix are not compiled at all, but they are included
     among the output files, so they will be linked.

`%O'
     Substitutes the suffix for object files.  Note that this is
     handled specially when it immediately follows `%g, %u, or %U',
     because of the need for those to form complete file names.  The
     handling is such that `%O' is treated exactly as if it had already
     been substituted, except that `%g, %u, and %U' do not currently
     support additional SUFFIX characters following `%O' as they would
     following, for example, `.o'.

`%p'
     Substitutes the standard macro predefinitions for the current
     target machine.  Use this when running `cpp'.

`%P'
     Like `%p', but puts `__' before and after the name of each
     predefined macro, except for macros that start with `__' or with
     `_L', where L is an uppercase letter.  This is for ISO C.

`%I'
     Substitute any of `-iprefix' (made from `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'),
     `-isysroot' (made from `TARGET_SYSTEM_ROOT'), `-isystem' (made
     from `COMPILER_PATH' and `-B' options) and `-imultilib' as
     necessary.

`%s'
     Current argument is the name of a library or startup file of some
     sort.  Search for that file in a standard list of directories and
     substitute the full name found.  The current working directory is
     included in the list of directories scanned.

`%T'
     Current argument is the name of a linker script.  Search for that
     file in the current list of directories to scan for libraries. If
     the file is located insert a `--script' option into the command
     line followed by the full path name found.  If the file is not
     found then generate an error message.  Note: the current working
     directory is not searched.

`%eSTR'
     Print STR as an error message.  STR is terminated by a newline.
     Use this when inconsistent options are detected.

`%(NAME)'
     Substitute the contents of spec string NAME at this point.

`%[NAME]'
     Like `%(...)' but put `__' around `-D' arguments.

`%x{OPTION}'
     Accumulate an option for `%X'.

`%X'
     Output the accumulated linker options specified by `-Wl' or a `%x'
     spec string.

`%Y'
     Output the accumulated assembler options specified by `-Wa'.

`%Z'
     Output the accumulated preprocessor options specified by `-Wp'.

`%a'
     Process the `asm' spec.  This is used to compute the switches to
     be passed to the assembler.

`%A'
     Process the `asm_final' spec.  This is a spec string for passing
     switches to an assembler post-processor, if such a program is
     needed.

`%l'
     Process the `link' spec.  This is the spec for computing the
     command line passed to the linker.  Typically it will make use of
     the `%L %G %S %D and %E' sequences.

`%D'
     Dump out a `-L' option for each directory that GCC believes might
     contain startup files.  If the target supports multilibs then the
     current multilib directory will be prepended to each of these
     paths.

`%L'
     Process the `lib' spec.  This is a spec string for deciding which
     libraries should be included on the command line to the linker.

`%G'
     Process the `libgcc' spec.  This is a spec string for deciding
     which GCC support library should be included on the command line
     to the linker.

`%S'
     Process the `startfile' spec.  This is a spec for deciding which
     object files should be the first ones passed to the linker.
     Typically this might be a file named `crt0.o'.

`%E'
     Process the `endfile' spec.  This is a spec string that specifies
     the last object files that will be passed to the linker.

`%C'
     Process the `cpp' spec.  This is used to construct the arguments
     to be passed to the C preprocessor.

`%1'
     Process the `cc1' spec.  This is used to construct the options to
     be passed to the actual C compiler (`cc1').

`%2'
     Process the `cc1plus' spec.  This is used to construct the options
     to be passed to the actual C++ compiler (`cc1plus').

`%*'
     Substitute the variable part of a matched option.  See below.
     Note that each comma in the substituted string is replaced by a
     single space.

`%<`S''
     Remove all occurrences of `-S' from the command line.  Note--this
     command is position dependent.  `%' commands in the spec string
     before this one will see `-S', `%' commands in the spec string
     after this one will not.

`%:FUNCTION(ARGS)'
     Call the named function FUNCTION, passing it ARGS.  ARGS is first
     processed as a nested spec string, then split into an argument
     vector in the usual fashion.  The function returns a string which
     is processed as if it had appeared literally as part of the
     current spec.

     The following built-in spec functions are provided:

    ``getenv''
          The `getenv' spec function takes two arguments: an environment
          variable name and a string.  If the environment variable is
          not defined, a fatal error is issued.  Otherwise, the return
          value is the value of the environment variable concatenated
          with the string.  For example, if `TOPDIR' is defined as
          `/path/to/top', then:

               %:getenv(TOPDIR /include)

          expands to `/path/to/top/include'.

    ``if-exists''
          The `if-exists' spec function takes one argument, an absolute
          pathname to a file.  If the file exists, `if-exists' returns
          the pathname.  Here is a small example of its usage:

               *startfile:
               crt0%O%s %:if-exists(crti%O%s) crtbegin%O%s

    ``if-exists-else''
          The `if-exists-else' spec function is similar to the
          `if-exists' spec function, except that it takes two
          arguments.  The first argument is an absolute pathname to a
          file.  If the file exists, `if-exists-else' returns the
          pathname.  If it does not exist, it returns the second
          argument.  This way, `if-exists-else' can be used to select
          one file or another, based on the existence of the first.
          Here is a small example of its usage:

               *startfile:
               crt0%O%s %:if-exists(crti%O%s) \
               %:if-exists-else(crtbeginT%O%s crtbegin%O%s)

    ``replace-outfile''
          The `replace-outfile' spec function takes two arguments.  It
          looks for the first argument in the outfiles array and
          replaces it with the second argument.  Here is a small
          example of its usage:

               %{fgnu-runtime:%:replace-outfile(-lobjc -lobjc-gnu)}

    ``print-asm-header''
          The `print-asm-header' function takes no arguments and simply
          prints a banner like:

               Assembler options
               =================

               Use "-Wa,OPTION" to pass "OPTION" to the assembler.

          It is used to separate compiler options from assembler options
          in the `--target-help' output.

`%{`S'}'
     Substitutes the `-S' switch, if that switch was given to GCC.  If
     that switch was not specified, this substitutes nothing.  Note that
     the leading dash is omitted when specifying this option, and it is
     automatically inserted if the substitution is performed.  Thus the
     spec string `%{foo}' would match the command-line option `-foo'
     and would output the command line option `-foo'.

`%W{`S'}'
     Like %{`S'} but mark last argument supplied within as a file to be
     deleted on failure.

`%{`S'*}'
     Substitutes all the switches specified to GCC whose names start
     with `-S', but which also take an argument.  This is used for
     switches like `-o', `-D', `-I', etc.  GCC considers `-o foo' as
     being one switch whose names starts with `o'.  %{o*} would
     substitute this text, including the space.  Thus two arguments
     would be generated.

`%{`S'*&`T'*}'
     Like %{`S'*}, but preserve order of `S' and `T' options (the order
     of `S' and `T' in the spec is not significant).  There can be any
     number of ampersand-separated variables; for each the wild card is
     optional.  Useful for CPP as `%{D*&U*&A*}'.

`%{`S':`X'}'
     Substitutes `X', if the `-S' switch was given to GCC.

`%{!`S':`X'}'
     Substitutes `X', if the `-S' switch was _not_ given to GCC.

`%{`S'*:`X'}'
     Substitutes `X' if one or more switches whose names start with
     `-S' are specified to GCC.  Normally `X' is substituted only once,
     no matter how many such switches appeared.  However, if `%*'
     appears somewhere in `X', then `X' will be substituted once for
     each matching switch, with the `%*' replaced by the part of that
     switch that matched the `*'.

`%{.`S':`X'}'
     Substitutes `X', if processing a file with suffix `S'.

`%{!.`S':`X'}'
     Substitutes `X', if _not_ processing a file with suffix `S'.

`%{,`S':`X'}'
     Substitutes `X', if processing a file for language `S'.

`%{!,`S':`X'}'
     Substitutes `X', if not processing a file for language `S'.

`%{`S'|`P':`X'}'
     Substitutes `X' if either `-S' or `-P' was given to GCC.  This may
     be combined with `!', `.', `,', and `*' sequences as well,
     although they have a stronger binding than the `|'.  If `%*'
     appears in `X', all of the alternatives must be starred, and only
     the first matching alternative is substituted.

     For example, a spec string like this:

          %{.c:-foo} %{!.c:-bar} %{.c|d:-baz} %{!.c|d:-boggle}

     will output the following command-line options from the following
     input command-line options:

          fred.c        -foo -baz
          jim.d         -bar -boggle
          -d fred.c     -foo -baz -boggle
          -d jim.d      -bar -baz -boggle

`%{S:X; T:Y; :D}'
     If `S' was given to GCC, substitutes `X'; else if `T' was given to
     GCC, substitutes `Y'; else substitutes `D'.  There can be as many
     clauses as you need.  This may be combined with `.', `,', `!',
     `|', and `*' as needed.


 The conditional text `X' in a %{`S':`X'} or similar construct may
contain other nested `%' constructs or spaces, or even newlines.  They
are processed as usual, as described above.  Trailing white space in
`X' is ignored.  White space may also appear anywhere on the left side
of the colon in these constructs, except between `.' or `*' and the
corresponding word.

 The `-O', `-f', `-m', and `-W' switches are handled specifically in
these constructs.  If another value of `-O' or the negated form of a
`-f', `-m', or `-W' switch is found later in the command line, the
earlier switch value is ignored, except with {`S'*} where `S' is just
one letter, which passes all matching options.

 The character `|' at the beginning of the predicate text is used to
indicate that a command should be piped to the following command, but
only if `-pipe' is specified.

 It is built into GCC which switches take arguments and which do not.
(You might think it would be useful to generalize this to allow each
compiler's spec to say which switches take arguments.  But this cannot
be done in a consistent fashion.  GCC cannot even decide which input
files have been specified without knowing which switches take arguments,
and it must know which input files to compile in order to tell which
compilers to run).

 GCC also knows implicitly that arguments starting in `-l' are to be
treated as compiler output files, and passed to the linker in their
proper position among the other output files.

3.16 Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version
===================================================

The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called `gcc', or
`<machine>-gcc' when cross-compiling, or `<machine>-gcc-<version>' to
run a version other than the one that was installed last.  Sometimes
this is inconvenient, so GCC provides options that will switch to
another cross-compiler or version.

`-b MACHINE'
     The argument MACHINE specifies the target machine for compilation.

     The value to use for MACHINE is the same as was specified as the
     machine type when configuring GCC as a cross-compiler.  For
     example, if a cross-compiler was configured with `configure
     arm-elf', meaning to compile for an arm processor with elf
     binaries, then you would specify `-b arm-elf' to run that cross
     compiler.  Because there are other options beginning with `-b', the
     configuration must contain a hyphen, or `-b' alone should be one
     argument followed by the configuration in the next argument.

`-V VERSION'
     The argument VERSION specifies which version of GCC to run.  This
     is useful when multiple versions are installed.  For example,
     VERSION might be `4.0', meaning to run GCC version 4.0.

 The `-V' and `-b' options work by running the
`<machine>-gcc-<version>' executable, so there's no real reason to use
them if you can just run that directly.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Submodel Options,  Next: Code Gen Options,  Prev: Target Options,  Up: Invoking GCC

3.17 Hardware Models and Configurations
=======================================

Earlier we discussed the standard option `-b' which chooses among
different installed compilers for completely different target machines,
such as VAX vs. 68000 vs. 80386.

 In addition, each of these target machine types can have its own
special options, starting with `-m', to choose among various hardware
models or configurations--for example, 68010 vs 68020, floating
coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the compiler can
compile for any model or configuration, according to the options
specified.

 Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.

3.17.1 ARC Options
------------------

These options are defined for ARC implementations:

`-EL'
     Compile code for little endian mode.  This is the default.

`-EB'
     Compile code for big endian mode.

`-mmangle-cpu'
     Prepend the name of the cpu to all public symbol names.  In
     multiple-processor systems, there are many ARC variants with
     different instruction and register set characteristics.  This flag
     prevents code compiled for one cpu to be linked with code compiled
     for another.  No facility exists for handling variants that are
     "almost identical".  This is an all or nothing option.

`-mcpu=CPU'
     Compile code for ARC variant CPU.  Which variants are supported
     depend on the configuration.  All variants support `-mcpu=base',
     this is the default.

`-mtext=TEXT-SECTION'
`-mdata=DATA-SECTION'
`-mrodata=READONLY-DATA-SECTION'
     Put functions, data, and readonly data in TEXT-SECTION,
     DATA-SECTION, and READONLY-DATA-SECTION respectively by default.
     This can be overridden with the `section' attribute.  *Note
     Variable Attributes::.

`-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd'
     Some Cortex-M3 cores can cause data corruption when `ldrd'
     instructions with overlapping destination and base registers are
     used.  This option avoids generating these instructions.  This
     option is enabled by default when `-mcpu=cortex-m3' is specified.



File: gcc.info,  Node: ARM Options,  Next: AVR Options,  Prev: ARC Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.2 ARM Options
------------------

These `-m' options are defined for Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
architectures:

`-mabi=NAME'
     Generate code for the specified ABI.  Permissible values are:
     `apcs-gnu', `atpcs', `aapcs', `aapcs-linux' and `iwmmxt'.

`-mapcs-frame'
     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Procedure
     Call Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly
     necessary for correct execution of the code.  Specifying
     `-fomit-frame-pointer' with this option will cause the stack
     frames not to be generated for leaf functions.  The default is
     `-mno-apcs-frame'.

`-mapcs'
     This is a synonym for `-mapcs-frame'.

`-mthumb-interwork'
     Generate code which supports calling between the ARM and Thumb
     instruction sets.  Without this option the two instruction sets
     cannot be reliably used inside one program.  The default is
     `-mno-thumb-interwork', since slightly larger code is generated
     when `-mthumb-interwork' is specified.

`-mno-sched-prolog'
     Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prolog, or
     the merging of those instruction with the instructions in the
     function's body.  This means that all functions will start with a
     recognizable set of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from
     a small set of different function prologues), and this information
     can be used to locate the start if functions inside an executable
     piece of code.  The default is `-msched-prolog'.

`-mfloat-abi=NAME'
     Specifies which floating-point ABI to use.  Permissible values
     are: `soft', `softfp' and `hard'.

     Specifying `soft' causes GCC to generate output containing library
     calls for floating-point operations.  `softfp' allows the
     generation of code using hardware floating-point instructions, but
     still uses the soft-float calling conventions.  `hard' allows
     generation of floating-point instructions and uses FPU-specific
     calling conventions.

     The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note
     that the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible;
     you must compile your entire program with the same ABI, and link
     with a compatible set of libraries.

`-mhard-float'
     Equivalent to `-mfloat-abi=hard'.

`-msoft-float'
     Equivalent to `-mfloat-abi=soft'.

`-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This
     is the default for all standard configurations.

`-mbig-endian'
     Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the
     default is to compile code for a little-endian processor.

`-mwords-little-endian'
     This option only applies when generating code for big-endian
     processors.  Generate code for a little-endian word order but a
     big-endian byte order.  That is, a byte order of the form
     `32107654'.  Note: this option should only be used if you require
     compatibility with code for big-endian ARM processors generated by
     versions of the compiler prior to 2.8.

`-mcpu=NAME'
     This specifies the name of the target ARM processor.  GCC uses
     this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
     generating assembly code.  Permissible names are: `arm2', `arm250',
     `arm3', `arm6', `arm60', `arm600', `arm610', `arm620', `arm7',
     `arm7m', `arm7d', `arm7dm', `arm7di', `arm7dmi', `arm70', `arm700',
     `arm700i', `arm710', `arm710c', `arm7100', `arm720', `arm7500',
     `arm7500fe', `arm7tdmi', `arm7tdmi-s', `arm710t', `arm720t',
     `arm740t', `strongarm', `strongarm110', `strongarm1100',
     `strongarm1110', `arm8', `arm810', `arm9', `arm9e', `arm920',
     `arm920t', `arm922t', `arm946e-s', `arm966e-s', `arm968e-s',
     `arm926ej-s', `arm940t', `arm9tdmi', `arm10tdmi', `arm1020t',
     `arm1026ej-s', `arm10e', `arm1020e', `arm1022e', `arm1136j-s',

     `cortex-a8', `cortex-a9', `cortex-r4', `cortex-r4f', `cortex-m3',
     `cortex-m1', `cortex-m0', `xscale', `iwmmxt', `iwmmxt2', `ep9312'.

`-mtune=NAME'
     This option is very similar to the `-mcpu=' option, except that
     instead of specifying the actual target processor type, and hence
     restricting which instructions can be used, it specifies that GCC
     should tune the performance of the code as if the target were of
     the type specified in this option, but still choosing the
     instructions that it will generate based on the cpu specified by a
     `-mcpu=' option.  For some ARM implementations better performance
     can be obtained by using this option.

`-march=NAME'
     This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture.  GCC uses
     this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
     generating assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction
     with or instead of the `-mcpu=' option.  Permissible names are:
     `armv2', `armv2a', `armv3', `armv3m', `armv4', `armv4t', `armv5',
     `armv5t', `armv5e', `armv5te', `armv6', `armv6j', `armv6t2',
     `armv6z', `armv6zk', `armv6-m', `armv7', `armv7-a', `armv7-r',
     `armv7-m', `iwmmxt', `iwmmxt2', `ep9312'.

`-mfpu=NAME'
`-mfpe=NUMBER'
`-mfp=NUMBER'
     This specifies what floating point hardware (or hardware
     emulation) is available on the target.  Permissible names are:
     `fpa', `fpe2', `fpe3', `maverick', `vfp', `vfpv3', `vfpv3-fp16',
     `vfpv3-d16', `vfpv3-d16-fp16', `vfpv3xd', `vfpv3xd-fp16', `neon',
     `neon-fp16', `vfpv4', `vfpv4-d16', `fpv4-sp-d16' and `neon-vfpv4'.
     `-mfp' and `-mfpe' are synonyms for `-mfpu'=`fpe'NUMBER, for
     compatibility with older versions of GCC.

     If `-msoft-float' is specified this specifies the format of
     floating point values.

`-mfp16-format=NAME'
     Specify the format of the `__fp16' half-precision floating-point
     type.  Permissible names are `none', `ieee', and `alternative';
     the default is `none', in which case the `__fp16' type is not
     defined.  *Note Half-Precision::, for more information.

`-mstructure-size-boundary=N'
     The size of all structures and unions will be rounded up to a
     multiple of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible
     values are 8, 32 and 64.  The default value varies for different
     toolchains.  For the COFF targeted toolchain the default value is
     8.  A value of 64 is only allowed if the underlying ABI supports
     it.

     Specifying the larger number can produce faster, more efficient
     code, but can also increase the size of the program.  Different
     values are potentially incompatible.  Code compiled with one value
     cannot necessarily expect to work with code or libraries compiled
     with another value, if they exchange information using structures
     or unions.

`-mabort-on-noreturn'
     Generate a call to the function `abort' at the end of a `noreturn'
     function.  It will be executed if the function tries to return.

`-mlong-calls'
`-mno-long-calls'
     Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
     address of the function into a register and then performing a
     subroutine call on this register.  This switch is needed if the
     target function will lie outside of the 64 megabyte addressing
     range of the offset based version of subroutine call instruction.

     Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls will be
     turned into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions,
     functions which have the `short-call' attribute, functions that
     are inside the scope of a `#pragma no_long_calls' directive and
     functions whose definitions have already been compiled within the
     current compilation unit, will not be turned into long calls.  The
     exception to this rule is that weak function definitions,
     functions with the `long-call' attribute or the `section'
     attribute, and functions that are within the scope of a `#pragma
     long_calls' directive, will always be turned into long calls.

     This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
     `-mno-long-calls' will restore the default behavior, as will
     placing the function calls within the scope of a `#pragma
     long_calls_off' directive.  Note these switches have no effect on
     how the compiler generates code to handle function calls via
     function pointers.

`-msingle-pic-base'
     Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather
     than loading it in the prologue for each function.  The run-time
     system is responsible for initializing this register with an
     appropriate value before execution begins.

`-mpic-register=REG'
     Specify the register to be used for PIC addressing.  The default
     is R10 unless stack-checking is enabled, when R9 is used.

`-mcirrus-fix-invalid-insns'
     Insert NOPs into the instruction stream to in order to work around
     problems with invalid Maverick instruction combinations.  This
     option is only valid if the `-mcpu=ep9312' option has been used to
     enable generation of instructions for the Cirrus Maverick floating
     point co-processor.  This option is not enabled by default, since
     the problem is only present in older Maverick implementations.
     The default can be re-enabled by use of the
     `-mno-cirrus-fix-invalid-insns' switch.

`-mpoke-function-name'
     Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
     preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to
     this:

               t0
                   .ascii "arm_poke_function_name", 0
                   .align
               t1
                   .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0)
               arm_poke_function_name
                   mov     ip, sp
                   stmfd   sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
                   sub     fp, ip, #4

     When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
     `pc' stored at `fp + 0'.  If the trace function then looks at
     location `pc - 12' and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
     there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this
     location and has length `((pc[-3]) & 0xff000000)'.

`-mthumb'
     Generate code for the Thumb instruction set.  The default is to
     use the 32-bit ARM instruction set.  This option automatically
     enables either 16-bit Thumb-1 or mixed 16/32-bit Thumb-2
     instructions based on the `-mcpu=NAME' and `-march=NAME' options.
     This option is not passed to the assembler. If you want to force
     assembler files to be interpreted as Thumb code, either add a
     `.thumb' directive to the source or pass the `-mthumb' option
     directly to the assembler by prefixing it with `-Wa'.

`-mtpcs-frame'
     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure
     Call Standard for all non-leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one
     that does not call any other functions.)  The default is
     `-mno-tpcs-frame'.

`-mtpcs-leaf-frame'
     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure
     Call Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one
     that does not call any other functions.)  The default is
     `-mno-apcs-leaf-frame'.

`-mcallee-super-interworking'
     Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled
     an ARM instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before
     executing the rest of the function.  This allows these functions
     to be called from non-interworking code.  This option is not valid
     in AAPCS configurations because interworking is enabled by default.

`-mcaller-super-interworking'
     Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
     execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been
     compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in
     the cost of executing a function pointer if this option is
     enabled.  This option is not valid in AAPCS configurations because
     interworking is enabled by default.

`-mtp=NAME'
     Specify the access model for the thread local storage pointer.
     The valid models are `soft', which generates calls to
     `__aeabi_read_tp', `cp15', which fetches the thread pointer from
     `cp15' directly (supported in the arm6k architecture), and `auto',
     which uses the best available method for the selected processor.
     The default setting is `auto'.

`-mword-relocations'
     Only generate absolute relocations on word sized values (i.e.
     R_ARM_ABS32).  This is enabled by default on targets (uClinux,
     SymbianOS) where the runtime loader imposes this restriction, and
     when `-fpic' or `-fPIC' is specified.



File: gcc.info,  Node: AVR Options,  Next: Blackfin Options,  Prev: ARM Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.3 AVR Options
------------------

These options are defined for AVR implementations:

`-mmcu=MCU'
     Specify ATMEL AVR instruction set or MCU type.

     Instruction set avr1 is for the minimal AVR core, not supported by
     the C compiler, only for assembler programs (MCU types: at90s1200,
     attiny10, attiny11, attiny12, attiny15, attiny28).

     Instruction set avr2 (default) is for the classic AVR core with up
     to 8K program memory space (MCU types: at90s2313, at90s2323,
     attiny22, at90s2333, at90s2343, at90s4414, at90s4433, at90s4434,
     at90s8515, at90c8534, at90s8535).

     Instruction set avr3 is for the classic AVR core with up to 128K
     program memory space (MCU types: atmega103, atmega603, at43usb320,
     at76c711).

     Instruction set avr4 is for the enhanced AVR core with up to 8K
     program memory space (MCU types: atmega8, atmega83, atmega85).

     Instruction set avr5 is for the enhanced AVR core with up to 128K
     program memory space (MCU types: atmega16, atmega161, atmega163,
     atmega32, atmega323, atmega64, atmega128, at43usb355, at94k).

`-mno-interrupts'
     Generated code is not compatible with hardware interrupts.  Code
     size will be smaller.

`-mcall-prologues'
     Functions prologues/epilogues expanded as call to appropriate
     subroutines.  Code size will be smaller.

`-mtiny-stack'
     Change only the low 8 bits of the stack pointer.

`-mint8'
     Assume int to be 8 bit integer.  This affects the sizes of all
     types: A char will be 1 byte, an int will be 1 byte, a long will
     be 2 bytes and long long will be 4 bytes.  Please note that this
     option does not comply to the C standards, but it will provide you
     with smaller code size.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Blackfin Options,  Next: CRIS Options,  Prev: AVR Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.4 Blackfin Options
-----------------------

`-mcpu=CPU[-SIREVISION]'
     Specifies the name of the target Blackfin processor.  Currently,
     CPU can be one of `bf512', `bf514', `bf516', `bf518', `bf522',
     `bf523', `bf524', `bf525', `bf526', `bf527', `bf531', `bf532',
     `bf533', `bf534', `bf536', `bf537', `bf538', `bf539', `bf542',
     `bf544', `bf547', `bf548', `bf549', `bf542m', `bf544m', `bf547m',
     `bf548m', `bf549m', `bf561'.  The optional SIREVISION specifies
     the silicon revision of the target Blackfin processor.  Any
     workarounds available for the targeted silicon revision will be
     enabled.  If SIREVISION is `none', no workarounds are enabled.  If
     SIREVISION is `any', all workarounds for the targeted processor
     will be enabled.  The `__SILICON_REVISION__' macro is defined to
     two hexadecimal digits representing the major and minor numbers in
     the silicon revision.  If SIREVISION is `none', the
     `__SILICON_REVISION__' is not defined.  If SIREVISION is `any', the
     `__SILICON_REVISION__' is defined to be `0xffff'.  If this
     optional SIREVISION is not used, GCC assumes the latest known
     silicon revision of the targeted Blackfin processor.

     Support for `bf561' is incomplete.  For `bf561', Only the
     processor macro is defined.  Without this option, `bf532' is used
     as the processor by default.  The corresponding predefined
     processor macros for CPU is to be defined.  And for `bfin-elf'
     toolchain, this causes the hardware BSP provided by libgloss to be
     linked in if `-msim' is not given.

`-msim'
     Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This
     causes the simulator BSP provided by libgloss to be linked in.
     This option has effect only for `bfin-elf' toolchain.  Certain
     other options, such as `-mid-shared-library' and `-mfdpic', imply
     `-msim'.

`-momit-leaf-frame-pointer'
     Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.
     This avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore frame
     pointers and makes an extra register available in leaf functions.
     The option `-fomit-frame-pointer' removes the frame pointer for
     all functions which might make debugging harder.

`-mspecld-anomaly'
     When enabled, the compiler will ensure that the generated code
     does not contain speculative loads after jump instructions. If
     this option is used, `__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_LOADS' is defined.

`-mno-specld-anomaly'
     Don't generate extra code to prevent speculative loads from
     occurring.

`-mcsync-anomaly'
     When enabled, the compiler will ensure that the generated code
     does not contain CSYNC or SSYNC instructions too soon after
     conditional branches.  If this option is used,
     `__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_SYNCS' is defined.

`-mno-csync-anomaly'
     Don't generate extra code to prevent CSYNC or SSYNC instructions
     from occurring too soon after a conditional branch.

`-mlow-64k'
     When enabled, the compiler is free to take advantage of the
     knowledge that the entire program fits into the low 64k of memory.

`-mno-low-64k'
     Assume that the program is arbitrarily large.  This is the default.

`-mstack-check-l1'
     Do stack checking using information placed into L1 scratchpad
     memory by the uClinux kernel.

`-mid-shared-library'
     Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID
     method.  This allows for execute in place and shared libraries in
     an environment without virtual memory management.  This option
     implies `-fPIC'.  With a `bfin-elf' target, this option implies
     `-msim'.

`-mno-id-shared-library'
     Generate code that doesn't assume ID based shared libraries are
     being used.  This is the default.

`-mleaf-id-shared-library'
     Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID
     method, but assumes that this library or executable won't link
     against any other ID shared libraries.  That allows the compiler
     to use faster code for jumps and calls.

`-mno-leaf-id-shared-library'
     Do not assume that the code being compiled won't link against any
     ID shared libraries.  Slower code will be generated for jump and
     call insns.

`-mshared-library-id=n'
     Specified the identification number of the ID based shared library
     being compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 will generate more
     compact code, specifying other values will force the allocation of
     that number to the current library but is no more space or time
     efficient than omitting this option.

`-msep-data'
     Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a
     different area of memory from the text segment.  This allows for
     execute in place in an environment without virtual memory
     management by eliminating relocations against the text section.

`-mno-sep-data'
     Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text
     segment.  This is the default.

`-mlong-calls'
`-mno-long-calls'
     Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
     address of the function into a register and then performing a
     subroutine call on this register.  This switch is needed if the
     target function will lie outside of the 24 bit addressing range of
     the offset based version of subroutine call instruction.

     This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
     `-mno-long-calls' will restore the default behavior.  Note these
     switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to
     handle function calls via function pointers.

`-mfast-fp'
     Link with the fast floating-point library. This library relaxes
     some of the IEEE floating-point standard's rules for checking
     inputs against Not-a-Number (NAN), in the interest of performance.

`-minline-plt'
     Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions that
     are not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without `-mfdpic'.

`-mmulticore'
     Build standalone application for multicore Blackfin processor.
     Proper start files and link scripts will be used to support
     multicore.  This option defines `__BFIN_MULTICORE'. It can only be
     used with `-mcpu=bf561[-SIREVISION]'. It can be used with
     `-mcorea' or `-mcoreb'. If it's used without `-mcorea' or
     `-mcoreb', single application/dual core programming model is used.
     In this model, the main function of Core B should be named as
     coreb_main. If it's used with `-mcorea' or `-mcoreb', one
     application per core programming model is used.  If this option is
     not used, single core application programming model is used.

`-mcorea'
     Build standalone application for Core A of BF561 when using one
     application per core programming model. Proper start files and
     link scripts will be used to support Core A. This option defines
     `__BFIN_COREA'. It must be used with `-mmulticore'.

`-mcoreb'
     Build standalone application for Core B of BF561 when using one
     application per core programming model. Proper start files and
     link scripts will be used to support Core B. This option defines
     `__BFIN_COREB'. When this option is used, coreb_main should be
     used instead of main. It must be used with `-mmulticore'.

`-msdram'
     Build standalone application for SDRAM. Proper start files and
     link scripts will be used to put the application into SDRAM.
     Loader should initialize SDRAM before loading the application into
     SDRAM. This option defines `__BFIN_SDRAM'.

`-micplb'
     Assume that ICPLBs are enabled at runtime.  This has an effect on
     certain anomaly workarounds.  For Linux targets, the default is to
     assume ICPLBs are enabled; for standalone applications the default
     is off.


File: gcc.info,  Node: CRIS Options,  Next: CRX Options,  Prev: Blackfin Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.5 CRIS Options
-------------------

These options are defined specifically for the CRIS ports.

`-march=ARCHITECTURE-TYPE'
`-mcpu=ARCHITECTURE-TYPE'
     Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices for
     ARCHITECTURE-TYPE are `v3', `v8' and `v10' for respectively
     ETRAX 4, ETRAX 100, and ETRAX 100 LX.  Default is `v0' except for
     cris-axis-linux-gnu, where the default is `v10'.

`-mtune=ARCHITECTURE-TYPE'
     Tune to ARCHITECTURE-TYPE everything applicable about the generated
     code, except for the ABI and the set of available instructions.
     The choices for ARCHITECTURE-TYPE are the same as for
     `-march=ARCHITECTURE-TYPE'.

`-mmax-stack-frame=N'
     Warn when the stack frame of a function exceeds N bytes.

`-metrax4'
`-metrax100'
     The options `-metrax4' and `-metrax100' are synonyms for
     `-march=v3' and `-march=v8' respectively.

`-mmul-bug-workaround'
`-mno-mul-bug-workaround'
     Work around a bug in the `muls' and `mulu' instructions for CPU
     models where it applies.  This option is active by default.

`-mpdebug'
     Enable CRIS-specific verbose debug-related information in the
     assembly code.  This option also has the effect to turn off the
     `#NO_APP' formatted-code indicator to the assembler at the
     beginning of the assembly file.

`-mcc-init'
     Do not use condition-code results from previous instruction;
     always emit compare and test instructions before use of condition
     codes.

`-mno-side-effects'
     Do not emit instructions with side-effects in addressing modes
     other than post-increment.

`-mstack-align'
`-mno-stack-align'
`-mdata-align'
`-mno-data-align'
`-mconst-align'
`-mno-const-align'
     These options (no-options) arranges (eliminate arrangements) for
     the stack-frame, individual data and constants to be aligned for
     the maximum single data access size for the chosen CPU model.  The
     default is to arrange for 32-bit alignment.  ABI details such as
     structure layout are not affected by these options.

`-m32-bit'
`-m16-bit'
`-m8-bit'
     Similar to the stack- data- and const-align options above, these
     options arrange for stack-frame, writable data and constants to
     all be 32-bit, 16-bit or 8-bit aligned.  The default is 32-bit
     alignment.

`-mno-prologue-epilogue'
`-mprologue-epilogue'
     With `-mno-prologue-epilogue', the normal function prologue and
     epilogue that sets up the stack-frame are omitted and no return
     instructions or return sequences are generated in the code.  Use
     this option only together with visual inspection of the compiled
     code: no warnings or errors are generated when call-saved
     registers must be saved, or storage for local variable needs to be
     allocated.

`-mno-gotplt'
`-mgotplt'
     With `-fpic' and `-fPIC', don't generate (do generate) instruction
     sequences that load addresses for functions from the PLT part of
     the GOT rather than (traditional on other architectures) calls to
     the PLT.  The default is `-mgotplt'.

`-melf'
     Legacy no-op option only recognized with the cris-axis-elf and
     cris-axis-linux-gnu targets.

`-mlinux'
     Legacy no-op option only recognized with the cris-axis-linux-gnu
     target.

`-sim'
     This option, recognized for the cris-axis-elf arranges to link
     with input-output functions from a simulator library.  Code,
     initialized data and zero-initialized data are allocated
     consecutively.

`-sim2'
     Like `-sim', but pass linker options to locate initialized data at
     0x40000000 and zero-initialized data at 0x80000000.

 FSF GCC on Darwin does not create "fat" object files; it will create
an object file for the single architecture that it was built to target.
Apple's GCC on Darwin does create "fat" files if multiple `-arch'
options are used; it does so by running the compiler or linker multiple
times and joining the results together with `lipo'.

 The subtype of the file created (like `ppc7400' or `ppc970' or `i686')
is determined by the flags that specify the ISA that GCC is targetting,
like `-mcpu' or `-march'.  The `-force_cpusubtype_ALL' option can be
used to override this.

 The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an ISA
mismatch.  The assembler, `as', will only permit instructions to be
used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating, so
you cannot put 64-bit instructions in a `ppc750' object file.  The
linker for shared libraries, `/usr/bin/libtool', will fail and print an
error if asked to create a shared library with a less restrictive
subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put a `ppc970'
object file in a `ppc7400' library).  The linker for executables, `ld',
will quietly give the executable the most restrictive subtype of any of
its input files.

`-FDIR'
     Add the framework directory DIR to the head of the list of
     directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
     interleaved with those specified by `-I' options and are scanned
     in a left-to-right order.

     A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
     framework is a directory with a `"Headers"' and/or
     `"PrivateHeaders"' directory contained directly in it that ends in
     `".framework"'.  The name of a framework is the name of this
     directory excluding the `".framework"'.  Headers associated with
     the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
     `"Headers"' being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
     directory that is in a framework's `"Frameworks"' directory.
     Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a
     framework that contains the subframework, or in a sibling
     subframework header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur
     in the same framework.  A subframework should not have the same
     name as a framework, a warning will be issued if this is violated.
     Currently a subframework cannot have subframeworks, in the future,
     the mechanism may be extended to support this.  The standard
     frameworks can be found in `"/System/Library/Frameworks"' and
     `"/Library/Frameworks"'.  An example include looks like `#include
     <Framework/header.h>', where `Framework' denotes the name of the
     framework and header.h is found in the `"PrivateHeaders"' or
     `"Headers"' directory.

`-iframeworkDIR'
     Like `-F' except the directory is a treated as a system directory.
     The main difference between this `-iframework' and `-F' is that
     with `-iframework' the compiler does not warn about constructs
     contained within header files found via DIR.  This option is valid
     only for the C family of languages.

`-gused'
     Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For STABS
     debugging format, this enables `-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols'.
     This is by default ON.

`-gfull'
     Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.

`-mmacosx-version-min=VERSION'
     The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on
     is VERSION.  Typical values of VERSION include `10.1', `10.2', and
     `10.3.9'.

     If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by default,
     then the default for this option is the system version on which the
     compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make choices which
     are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.

`-mkernel'
     Enable kernel development mode.  The `-mkernel' option sets
     `-static', `-fno-common', `-fno-cxa-atexit', `-fno-exceptions',
     `-fno-non-call-exceptions', `-fapple-kext', `-fno-weak' and
     `-fno-rtti' where applicable.  This mode also sets `-mno-altivec',
     `-msoft-float', `-fno-builtin' and `-mlong-branch' for PowerPC
     targets.

`-mone-byte-bool'
     Override the defaults for `bool' so that `sizeof(bool)==1'.  By
     default `sizeof(bool)' is `4' when compiling for Darwin/PowerPC
     and `1' when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this option has no
     effect on x86.

     *Warning:* The `-mone-byte-bool' switch causes GCC to generate
     code that is not binary compatible with code generated without
     that switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all other
     modules in a program, including system libraries.  Use this switch
     to conform to a non-default data model.

`-mfix-and-continue'
`-ffix-and-continue'
`-findirect-data'
     Generate code suitable for fast turn around development.  Needed to
     enable gdb to dynamically load `.o' files into already running
     programs.  `-findirect-data' and `-ffix-and-continue' are provided
     for backwards compatibility.

`-all_load'
     Loads all members of static archive libraries.  See man ld(1) for
     more information.

`-arch_errors_fatal'
     Cause the errors having to do with files that have the wrong
     architecture to be fatal.

`-bind_at_load'
     Causes the output file to be marked such that the dynamic linker
     will bind all undefined references when the file is loaded or
     launched.

`-bundle'
     Produce a Mach-o bundle format file.  See man ld(1) for more
     information.

`-bundle_loader EXECUTABLE'
     This option specifies the EXECUTABLE that will be loading the build
     output file being linked.  See man ld(1) for more information.

`-dynamiclib'
     When passed this option, GCC will produce a dynamic library
     instead of an executable when linking, using the Darwin `libtool'
     command.

`-force_cpusubtype_ALL'
     This causes GCC's output file to have the ALL subtype, instead of
     one controlled by the `-mcpu' or `-march' option.

`-allowable_client  CLIENT_NAME'
`-client_name'
`-compatibility_version'
`-current_version'
`-dead_strip'
`-dependency-file'
`-dylib_file'
`-dylinker_install_name'

File: gcc.info,  Node: DEC Alpha Options,  Next: DEC Alpha/VMS Options,  Prev: Darwin Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.8 DEC Alpha Options
------------------------

These `-m' options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:

`-mno-soft-float'
`-msoft-float'
     Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
     floating-point operations.  When `-msoft-float' is specified,
     functions in `libgcc.a' will be used to perform floating-point
     operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
     floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call
     such emulations routines, these routines will issue floating-point
     operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without
     floating-point operations, you must ensure that the library is
     built so as not to call them.

     Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations
     are required to have floating-point registers.

`-mfp-reg'
`-mno-fp-regs'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register
     set.  `-mno-fp-regs' implies `-msoft-float'.  If the floating-point
     register set is not used, floating point operands are passed in
     integer registers as if they were integers and floating-point
     results are passed in `$0' instead of `$f0'.  This is a
     non-standard calling sequence, so any function with a
     floating-point argument or return value called by code compiled
     with `-mno-fp-regs' must also be compiled with that option.

     A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not
     use, and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point
     registers.

`-mieee'
     The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware
     optimized for maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with
     the IEEE floating point standard.  However, for full compliance,
     software assistance is required.  This option generates code fully
     IEEE compliant code _except_ that the INEXACT-FLAG is not
     maintained (see below).  If this option is turned on, the
     preprocessor macro `_IEEE_FP' is defined during compilation.  The
     resulting code is less efficient but is able to correctly support
     denormalized numbers and exceptional IEEE values such as
     not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha compilers call
     this option `-ieee_with_no_inexact'.

`-mieee-with-inexact'
     This is like `-mieee' except the generated code also maintains the
     IEEE INEXACT-FLAG.  Turning on this option causes the generated
     code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math.  In addition to
     `_IEEE_FP', `_IEEE_FP_EXACT' is defined as a preprocessor macro.
     On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
     significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since
     there is very little code that depends on the INEXACT-FLAG, you
     should normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers
     call this option `-ieee_with_inexact'.

`-mfp-trap-mode=TRAP-MODE'
     This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled.
     Other Alpha compilers call this option `-fptm TRAP-MODE'.  The
     trap mode can be set to one of four values:

    `n'
          This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that
          are enabled are the ones that cannot be disabled in software
          (e.g., division by zero trap).

    `u'
          In addition to the traps enabled by `n', underflow traps are
          enabled as well.

    `su'
          Like `u', but the instructions are marked to be safe for
          software completion (see Alpha architecture manual for
          details).

    `sui'
          Like `su', but inexact traps are enabled as well.

`-mfp-rounding-mode=ROUNDING-MODE'
     Selects the IEEE rounding mode.  Other Alpha compilers call this
     option `-fprm ROUNDING-MODE'.  The ROUNDING-MODE can be one of:

    `n'
          Normal IEEE rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are
          rounded towards the nearest machine number or towards the
          even machine number in case of a tie.

    `m'
          Round towards minus infinity.

    `c'
          Chopped rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are rounded
          towards zero.

    `d'
          Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating point control
          register (FPCR, see Alpha architecture reference manual)
          controls the rounding mode in effect.  The C library
          initializes this register for rounding towards plus infinity.
          Thus, unless your program modifies the FPCR, `d' corresponds
          to round towards plus infinity.

`-mtrap-precision=TRAP-PRECISION'
     In the Alpha architecture, floating point traps are imprecise.
     This means without software assistance it is impossible to recover
     from a floating trap and program execution normally needs to be
     terminated.  GCC can generate code that can assist operating
     system trap handlers in determining the exact location that caused
     a floating point trap.  Depending on the requirements of an
     application, different levels of precisions can be selected:

    `p'
          Program precision.  This option is the default and means a
          trap handler can only identify which program caused a
          floating point exception.

    `f'
          Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the
          function that caused a floating point exception.

    `i'
          Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the
          exact instruction that caused a floating point exception.

     Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
     `-scope_safe' and `-resumption_safe'.

`-mieee-conformant'
     This option marks the generated code as IEEE conformant.  You must
     not use this option unless you also specify `-mtrap-precision=i'
     and either `-mfp-trap-mode=su' or `-mfp-trap-mode=sui'.  Its only
     effect is to emit the line `.eflag 48' in the function prologue of
     the generated assembly file.  Under DEC Unix, this has the effect
     that IEEE-conformant math library routines will be linked in.

`-mbuild-constants'
     Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to see if
     it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
     instructions.  If it cannot, it will output the constant as a
     literal and generate code to load it from the data segment at
     runtime.

     Use this option to require GCC to construct _all_ integer constants
     using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is
     six).

     You would typically use this option to build a shared library
     dynamic loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself
     in memory before it can find the variables and constants in its
     own data segment.

`-malpha-as'
`-mgas'
     Select whether to generate code to be assembled by the
     vendor-supplied assembler (`-malpha-as') or by the GNU assembler
     `-mgas'.

`-mbwx'
`-mno-bwx'
`-mcix'
`-mno-cix'
`-mfix'
`-mno-fix'
`-mmax'
`-mno-max'
     Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use the optional BWX,
     CIX, FIX and MAX instruction sets.  The default is to use the
     instruction sets supported by the CPU type specified via `-mcpu='
     option or that of the CPU on which GCC was built if none was
     specified.

`-mfloat-vax'
`-mfloat-ieee'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) VAX F and G floating point
     arithmetic instead of IEEE single and double precision.

`-mexplicit-relocs'
`-mno-explicit-relocs'
     Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol
     relocations except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does
     not allow optimal instruction scheduling.  GNU binutils as of
     version 2.12 supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to
     explicitly mark which relocations should apply to which
     instructions.  This option is mostly useful for debugging, as GCC
     detects the capabilities of the assembler when it is built and
     sets the default accordingly.

`-msmall-data'
`-mlarge-data'
     When `-mexplicit-relocs' is in effect, static data is accessed via
     "gp-relative" relocations.  When `-msmall-data' is used, objects 8
     bytes long or smaller are placed in a "small data area" (the
     `.sdata' and `.sbss' sections) and are accessed via 16-bit
     relocations off of the `$gp' register.  This limits the size of
     the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be
     directly accessed via a single instruction.

     The default is `-mlarge-data'.  With this option the data area is
     limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of
     data must use `malloc' or `mmap' to allocate the data in the heap
     instead of in the program's data segment.

     When generating code for shared libraries, `-fpic' implies
     `-msmall-data' and `-fPIC' implies `-mlarge-data'.

`-msmall-text'
`-mlarge-text'
     When `-msmall-text' is used, the compiler assumes that the code of
     the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB, and is thus
     reachable with a branch instruction.  When `-msmall-data' is used,
     the compiler can assume that all local symbols share the same
     `$gp' value, and thus reduce the number of instructions required
     for a function call from 4 to 1.

     The default is `-mlarge-text'.

`-mcpu=CPU_TYPE'
     Set the instruction set and instruction scheduling parameters for
     machine type CPU_TYPE.  You can specify either the `EV' style name
     or the corresponding chip number.  GCC supports scheduling
     parameters for the EV4, EV5 and EV6 family of processors and will
     choose the default values for the instruction set from the
     processor you specify.  If you do not specify a processor type,
     GCC will default to the processor on which the compiler was built.

     Supported values for CPU_TYPE are

    `ev4'
    `ev45'
    `21064'
          Schedules as an EV4 and has no instruction set extensions.

    `ev5'
    `21164'
          Schedules as an EV5 and has no instruction set extensions.

    `ev56'
    `21164a'
          Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX extension.

    `pca56'
    `21164pc'
    `21164PC'
          Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX and MAX extensions.

    `ev6'
    `21264'
          Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, FIX, and MAX
          extensions.

    `ev67'
    `21264a'
          Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, CIX, FIX, and MAX
          extensions.

     Native Linux/GNU toolchains also support the value `native', which
     selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
     `-mcpu=native' has no effect if GCC does not recognize the
     processor.

`-mtune=CPU_TYPE'
     Set only the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
     CPU_TYPE.  The instruction set is not changed.

     Native Linux/GNU toolchains also support the value `native', which
     selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
     `-mtune=native' has no effect if GCC does not recognize the
     processor.

`-mmemory-latency=TIME'
     Sets the latency the scheduler should assume for typical memory
     references as seen by the application.  This number is highly
     dependent on the memory access patterns used by the application
     and the size of the external cache on the machine.

     Valid options for TIME are

    `NUMBER'
          A decimal number representing clock cycles.

    `L1'
    `L2'
    `L3'
    `main'
          The compiler contains estimates of the number of clock cycles
          for "typical" EV4 & EV5 hardware for the Level 1, 2 & 3 caches
          (also called Dcache, Scache, and Bcache), as well as to main
          memory.  Note that L3 is only valid for EV5.

3.17.9 DEC Alpha/VMS Options
----------------------------

These `-m' options are defined for the DEC Alpha/VMS implementations:

`-mvms-return-codes'
     Return VMS condition codes from main.  The default is to return
     POSIX style condition (e.g. error) codes.

     Flag the first routine whose name starts with PREFIX as the main
     routine for the debugger.

`-mmalloc64'

3.17.10 FR30 Options
--------------------

These options are defined specifically for the FR30 port.

`-msmall-model'
     Use the small address space model.  This can produce smaller code,
     but it does assume that all symbolic values and addresses will fit
     into a 20-bit range.

`-mno-lsim'
     Assume that run-time support has been provided and so there is no
     need to include the simulator library (`libsim.a') on the linker
     command line.



File: gcc.info,  Node: FRV Options,  Next: GNU/Linux Options,  Prev: FR30 Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.11 FRV Options
-------------------

`-mgpr-32'
     Only use the first 32 general purpose registers.

`-mgpr-64'
     Use all 64 general purpose registers.

`-mfpr-32'
     Use only the first 32 floating point registers.

`-mfpr-64'
     Use all 64 floating point registers

`-mhard-float'
     Use hardware instructions for floating point operations.

`-msoft-float'
     Use library routines for floating point operations.

`-malloc-cc'
     Dynamically allocate condition code registers.

`-mfixed-cc'
     Do not try to dynamically allocate condition code registers, only
     use `icc0' and `fcc0'.

`-mdword'
     Change ABI to use double word insns.

`-mno-dword'
     Do not use double word instructions.

`-mdouble'
     Use floating point double instructions.

`-mno-double'
     Do not use floating point double instructions.

`-mmedia'
     Use media instructions.

`-mno-media'
     Do not use media instructions.

`-mmuladd'
     Use multiply and add/subtract instructions.

`-mno-muladd'
     Do not use multiply and add/subtract instructions.

`-mfdpic'
     Select the FDPIC ABI, that uses function descriptors to represent
     pointers to functions.  Without any PIC/PIE-related options, it
     implies `-fPIE'.  With `-fpic' or `-fpie', it assumes GOT entries
     and small data are within a 12-bit range from the GOT base
     address; with `-fPIC' or `-fPIE', GOT offsets are computed with 32
     bits.  With a `bfin-elf' target, this option implies `-msim'.

`-minline-plt'
     Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions that
     are not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without `-mfdpic'.
     It's enabled by default if optimizing for speed and compiling for
     shared libraries (i.e., `-fPIC' or `-fpic'), or when an
     optimization option such as `-O3' or above is present in the
     command line.

`-mTLS'
     Assume a large TLS segment when generating thread-local code.

`-mtls'
     Do not assume a large TLS segment when generating thread-local
     code.

`-mgprel-ro'
     Enable the use of `GPREL' relocations in the FDPIC ABI for data
     that is known to be in read-only sections.  It's enabled by
     default, except for `-fpic' or `-fpie': even though it may help
     make the global offset table smaller, it trades 1 instruction for
     4.  With `-fPIC' or `-fPIE', it trades 3 instructions for 4, one
     of which may be shared by multiple symbols, and it avoids the need
     for a GOT entry for the referenced symbol, so it's more likely to
     be a win.  If it is not, `-mno-gprel-ro' can be used to disable it.

`-multilib-library-pic'
     Link with the (library, not FD) pic libraries.  It's implied by
     `-mlibrary-pic', as well as by `-fPIC' and `-fpic' without
     `-mfdpic'.  You should never have to use it explicitly.

`-mlinked-fp'
     Follow the EABI requirement of always creating a frame pointer
     whenever a stack frame is allocated.  This option is enabled by
     default and can be disabled with `-mno-linked-fp'.

`-mlong-calls'
     Use indirect addressing to call functions outside the current
     compilation unit.  This allows the functions to be placed anywhere
     within the 32-bit address space.

`-malign-labels'
     Try to align labels to an 8-byte boundary by inserting nops into
     the previous packet.  This option only has an effect when VLIW

3.17.12 GNU/Linux Options
-------------------------

These `-m' options are defined for GNU/Linux targets:

`-mglibc'
     Use the GNU C library instead of uClibc.  This is the default

3.17.13 H8/300 Options
----------------------

These `-m' options are defined for the H8/300 implementations:

`-mrelax'
     Shorten some address references at link time, when possible; uses
     the linker option `-relax'.  *Note `ld' and the H8/300:
     (ld)H8/300, for a fuller description.

`-mh'
     Generate code for the H8/300H.

`-ms'
     Generate code for the H8S.

`-mn'
     Generate code for the H8S and H8/300H in the normal mode.  This
     switch must be used either with `-mh' or `-ms'.

`-ms2600'
     Generate code for the H8S/2600.  This switch must be used with
     `-ms'.

`-mint32'

`-malign-300'
     On the H8/300H and H8S, use the same alignment rules as for the
     H8/300.  The default for the H8/300H and H8S is to align longs and
     floats on 4 byte boundaries.  `-malign-300' causes them to be
     aligned on 2 byte boundaries.  This option has no effect on the
     H8/300.

3.17.14 HPPA Options
--------------------

These `-m' options are defined for the HPPA family of computers:

`-march=ARCHITECTURE-TYPE'
     Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices for
     ARCHITECTURE-TYPE are `1.0' for PA 1.0, `1.1' for PA 1.1, and
     `2.0' for PA 2.0 processors.  Refer to `/usr/lib/sched.models' on
     an HP-UX system to determine the proper architecture option for
     your machine.  Code compiled for lower numbered architectures will
     run on higher numbered architectures, but not the other way around.

`-mpa-risc-1-0'
`-mpa-risc-1-1'
`-mpa-risc-2-0'
     Synonyms for `-march=1.0', `-march=1.1', and `-march=2.0'
     respectively.

`-mbig-switch'
     Generate code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this option
     only if the assembler/linker complain about out of range branches
     within a switch table.

`-mjump-in-delay'
     Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump
     instructions by modifying the return pointer for the function call
     to be the target of the conditional jump.

`-mdisable-fpregs'
     Prevent floating point registers from being used in any manner.
     This is necessary for compiling kernels which perform lazy context
     switching of floating point registers.  If you use this option and
     attempt to perform floating point operations, the compiler will
     abort.

`-mdisable-indexing'
     Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This
     avoids some rather obscure problems when compiling MIG generated
     code under MACH.

`-mno-space-regs'
     Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.
     This allows GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled
     index address modes.

     Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.

`-mfast-indirect-calls'
     Generate code that assumes calls never cross space boundaries.
     This allows GCC to emit code which performs faster indirect calls.

     This option will not work in the presence of shared libraries or
     nested functions.

`-mfixed-range=REGISTER-RANGE'
     Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
     A fixed register is one that the register allocator can not use.
     This is useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is
     specified as two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register
     ranges can be specified separated by a comma.

`-mlong-load-store'
     Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes
     required by the HP-UX 10 linker.  This is equivalent to the `+k'
     option to the HP compilers.

`-mportable-runtime'
     Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF
     systems.

`-mgas'
     Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.

`-mschedule=CPU-TYPE'
     Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type
     CPU-TYPE.  The choices for CPU-TYPE are `700' `7100', `7100LC',
     `7200', `7300' and `8000'.  Refer to `/usr/lib/sched.models' on an
     HP-UX system to determine the proper scheduling option for your
     machine.  The default scheduling is `8000'.

`-mlinker-opt'
     Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes
     symbolic debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the
     HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9 linkers in which they give bogus error
     messages when linking some programs.

`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all HPPA
     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C
     compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in
     cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
     suitable library functions for cross-compilation.

     `-msoft-float' changes the calling convention in the output file;
     therefore, it is only useful if you compile _all_ of a program with
     this option.  In particular, you need to compile `libgcc.a', the
     library that comes with GCC, with `-msoft-float' in order for this
     to work.

`-msio'
     Generate the predefine, `_SIO', for server IO.  The default is
     `-mwsio'.  This generates the predefines, `__hp9000s700',
     `__hp9000s700__' and `_WSIO', for workstation IO.  These options
     are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.

`-mgnu-ld'
     Use GNU ld specific options.  This passes `-shared' to ld when
     building a shared library.  It is the default when GCC is
     configured, explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU linker.  This
     option does not have any affect on which ld is called, it only
     changes what parameters are passed to that ld.  The ld that is
     called is determined by the `--with-ld' configure option, GCC's
     program search path, and finally by the user's `PATH'.  The linker
     used by GCC can be printed using `which `gcc
     -print-prog-name=ld`'.  This option is only available on the 64
     bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with `hppa*64*-*-hpux*'.

`-mhp-ld'
     Use HP ld specific options.  This passes `-b' to ld when building
     a shared library and passes `+Accept TypeMismatch' to ld on all
     links.  It is the default when GCC is configured, explicitly or
     implicitly, with the HP linker.  This option does not have any
     affect on which ld is called, it only changes what parameters are
     passed to that ld.  The ld that is called is determined by the
     `--with-ld' configure option, GCC's program search path, and
     finally by the user's `PATH'.  The linker used by GCC can be
     printed using `which `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`'.  This option is
     only available on the 64 bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with
     `hppa*64*-*-hpux*'.

`-mlong-calls'
     Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a
     call is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default
     is to generate long calls only when the distance from the call
     site to the beginning of the function or translation unit, as the
     case may be, exceeds a predefined limit set by the branch type
     being used.  The limits for normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000
     bytes, respectively for the PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures.
     Sibcalls are always limited at 240,000 bytes.

     Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using
     the `-ffunction-sections' option, or when using the `-mgas' and
     `-mno-portable-runtime' options together under HP-UX with the SOM
     linker.

     It is normally not desirable to use this option as it will degrade
     performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
     particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.

     The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
     assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
     impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
     symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.
     However, an indirect call is used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code
     and it is quite long.

`-munix=UNIX-STD'
     Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the
     specified UNIX standard.  The choices for UNIX-STD are `93', `95'
     and `98'.  `93' is supported on all HP-UX versions.  `95' is
     available on HP-UX 10.10 and later.  `98' is available on HP-UX
     11.11 and later.  The default values are `93' for HP-UX 10.00,
     `95' for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and `98' for HP-UX 11.11 and
     later.

     `-munix=93' provides the same predefines as GCC 3.3 and 3.4.
     `-munix=95' provides additional predefines for `XOPEN_UNIX' and
     `_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED', and the startfile `unix95.o'.
     `-munix=98' provides additional predefines for `_XOPEN_UNIX',
     `_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED', `_INCLUDE__STDC_A1_SOURCE' and
     `_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500', and the startfile `unix98.o'.

     It is _important_ to note that this option changes the interfaces
     for various library routines.  It also affects the operational
     behavior of the C library.  Thus, _extreme_ care is needed in
     using this option.

     Library code that is intended to operate with more than one UNIX
     standard must test, set and restore the variable
     __XPG4_EXTENDED_MASK as appropriate.  Most GNU software doesn't
     provide this capability.

`-nolibdld'
     Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when
     the `-static' option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.

`-static'
     The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
     libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
     when the `-static' option is specified, special link options are
     needed to resolve this dependency.

     On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC driver adds the necessary options to
     link with libdld.sl when the `-static' option is specified.  This
     causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64-bit port,
     the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
     `-nolibdld' option can be used to prevent the GCC driver from
     adding these link options.

`-threads'
     Add support for multithreading with the "dce thread" library under
     HP-UX.  This option sets flags for both the preprocessor and
     linker.

3.17.15 Intel 386 and AMD x86-64 Options
----------------------------------------

These `-m' options are defined for the i386 and x86-64 family of
computers:

`-mtune=CPU-TYPE'
     Tune to CPU-TYPE everything applicable about the generated code,
     except for the ABI and the set of available instructions.  The
     choices for CPU-TYPE are:
    _generic_
          Produce code optimized for the most common IA32/AMD64/EM64T
          processors.  If you know the CPU on which your code will run,
          then you should use the corresponding `-mtune' option instead
          of `-mtune=generic'.  But, if you do not know exactly what
          CPU users of your application will have, then you should use
          this option.

          As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the
          behavior of this option will change.  Therefore, if you
          upgrade to a newer version of GCC, the code generated option
          will change to reflect the processors that were most common
          when that version of GCC was released.

          There is no `-march=generic' option because `-march'
          indicates the instruction set the compiler can use, and there
          is no generic instruction set applicable to all processors.
          In contrast, `-mtune' indicates the processor (or, in this
          case, collection of processors) for which the code is
          optimized.

    _native_
          This selects the CPU to tune for at compilation time by
          determining the processor type of the compiling machine.
          Using `-mtune=native' will produce code optimized for the
          local machine under the constraints of the selected
          instruction set.  Using `-march=native' will enable all
          instruction subsets supported by the local machine (hence the
          result might not run on different machines).

          Via C3-2 CPU with MMX and SSE instruction set support.  (No
          scheduling is implemented for this chip.)

    _geode_
          Embedded AMD CPU with MMX and 3DNow! instruction set support.

     While picking a specific CPU-TYPE will schedule things
     appropriately for that particular chip, the compiler will not
     generate any code that does not run on the i386 without the
     `-march=CPU-TYPE' option being used.

`-march=CPU-TYPE'
     Generate instructions for the machine type CPU-TYPE.  The choices
     for CPU-TYPE are the same as for `-mtune'.  Moreover, specifying
     `-march=CPU-TYPE' implies `-mtune=CPU-TYPE'.

`-mcpu=CPU-TYPE'
     A deprecated synonym for `-mtune'.

`-mfpmath=UNIT'
     Generate floating point arithmetics for selected unit UNIT.  The
     choices for UNIT are:

    `387'
          Use the standard 387 floating point coprocessor present
          majority of chips and emulated otherwise.  Code compiled with
          this option will run almost everywhere.  The temporary
          results are computed in 80bit precision instead of precision
          specified by the type resulting in slightly different results
          compared to most of other chips.  See `-ffloat-store' for
          more detailed description.

          This is the default choice for i386 compiler.

    `sse'
          Use scalar floating point instructions present in the SSE
          instruction set.  This instruction set is supported by
          Pentium3 and newer chips, in the AMD line by Athlon-4,
          Athlon-xp and Athlon-mp chips.  The earlier version of SSE
          instruction set supports only single precision arithmetics,
          thus the double and extended precision arithmetics is still
          done using 387.  Later version, present only in Pentium4 and
          the future AMD x86-64 chips supports double precision
          arithmetics too.

          For the i386 compiler, you need to use `-march=CPU-TYPE',
          `-msse' or `-msse2' switches to enable SSE extensions and
          make this option effective.  For the x86-64 compiler, these
          extensions are enabled by default.

          The resulting code should be considerably faster in the
          majority of cases and avoid the numerical instability
          problems of 387 code, but may break some existing code that
          expects temporaries to be 80bit.

          This is the default choice for the x86-64 compiler.

    `sse,387'
    `sse+387'
    `both'
          Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once.  This
          effectively double the amount of available registers and on
          chips with separate execution units for 387 and SSE the
          execution resources too.  Use this option with care, as it is
          still experimental, because the GCC register allocator does
          not model separate functional units well resulting in
          instable performance.

`-masm=DIALECT'
     Output asm instructions using selected DIALECT.  Supported choices
     are `intel' or `att' (the default one).  Darwin does not support
     `intel'.

`-mieee-fp'
`-mno-ieee-fp'
     Control whether or not the compiler uses IEEE floating point
     comparisons.  These handle correctly the case where the result of a
     comparison is unordered.

`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not part of GCC.  Normally
     the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
     this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
     your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
     cross-compilation.

     On machines where a function returns floating point results in the
     80387 register stack, some floating point opcodes may be emitted
     even if `-msoft-float' is used.

`-mno-fp-ret-in-387'
     Do not use the FPU registers for return values of functions.

     The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
     `float' and `double' in an FPU register, even if there is no FPU.
     The idea is that the operating system should emulate an FPU.

     The option `-mno-fp-ret-in-387' causes such values to be returned
     in ordinary CPU registers instead.

`-mno-fancy-math-387'
     Some 387 emulators do not support the `sin', `cos' and `sqrt'
     instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid generating
     those instructions.  This option is the default on FreeBSD,
     OpenBSD and NetBSD.  This option is overridden when `-march'
     indicates that the target cpu will always have an FPU and so the
     instruction will not need emulation.  As of revision 2.6.1, these
     instructions are not generated unless you also use the
     `-funsafe-math-optimizations' switch.

`-malign-double'
`-mno-align-double'
     Control whether GCC aligns `double', `long double', and `long
     long' variables on a two word boundary or a one word boundary.
     Aligning `double' variables on a two word boundary will produce
     code that runs somewhat faster on a `Pentium' at the expense of
     more memory.

     On x86-64, `-malign-double' is enabled by default.

     *Warning:* if you use the `-malign-double' switch, structures
     containing the above types will be aligned differently than the
     published application binary interface specifications for the 386
     and will not be binary compatible with structures in code compiled
     without that switch.

`-m96bit-long-double'
`-m128bit-long-double'
     These switches control the size of `long double' type.  The i386
     application binary interface specifies the size to be 96 bits, so
     `-m96bit-long-double' is the default in 32 bit mode.

     Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) would prefer `long double'
     to be aligned to an 8 or 16 byte boundary.  In arrays or structures
     conforming to the ABI, this would not be possible.  So specifying a
     `-m128bit-long-double' will align `long double' to a 16 byte
     boundary by padding the `long double' with an additional 32 bit
     zero.

     In the x86-64 compiler, `-m128bit-long-double' is the default
     choice as its ABI specifies that `long double' is to be aligned on
     16 byte boundary.

     Notice that neither of these options enable any extra precision
     over the x87 standard of 80 bits for a `long double'.

     *Warning:* if you override the default value for your target ABI,
     the structures and arrays containing `long double' variables will
     change their size as well as function calling convention for
     function taking `long double' will be modified.  Hence they will
     not be binary compatible with arrays or structures in code
     compiled without that switch.

`-mlarge-data-threshold=NUMBER'
     When `-mcmodel=medium' is specified, the data greater than
     THRESHOLD are placed in large data section.  This value must be the
     same across all object linked into the binary and defaults to
     65535.

`-mrtd'
     Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
     that take a fixed number of arguments return with the `ret' NUM
     instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
     saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
     the arguments there.

     You can specify that an individual function is called with this
     calling sequence with the function attribute `stdcall'.  You can
     also override the `-mrtd' option by using the function attribute
     `cdecl'.  *Note Function Attributes::.

     *Warning:* this calling convention is incompatible with the one
     normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
     libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.

     Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
     take variable numbers of arguments (including `printf'); otherwise
     incorrect code will be generated for calls to those functions.

     In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
     function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
     harmlessly ignored.)

`-mregparm=NUM'
     Control how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By
     default, no registers are used to pass arguments, and at most 3
     registers can be used.  You can control this behavior for a
     specific function by using the function attribute `regparm'.
     *Note Function Attributes::.

     *Warning:* if you use this switch, and NUM is nonzero, then you
     must build all modules with the same value, including any
     libraries.  This includes the system libraries and startup modules.

`-msseregparm'
     Use SSE register passing conventions for float and double arguments
     and return values.  You can control this behavior for a specific
     function by using the function attribute `sseregparm'.  *Note
     Function Attributes::.

     *Warning:* if you use this switch then you must build all modules
     with the same value, including any libraries.  This includes the
     system libraries and startup modules.

`-mpc32'
`-mpc64'
`-mpc80'
     Set 80387 floating-point precision to 32, 64 or 80 bits.  When
     `-mpc32' is specified, the significands of results of
     floating-point operations are rounded to 24 bits (single
     precision); `-mpc64' rounds the significands of results of
     floating-point operations to 53 bits (double precision) and
     `-mpc80' rounds the significands of results of floating-point
     operations to 64 bits (extended double precision), which is the
     default.  When this option is used, floating-point operations in
     higher precisions are not available to the programmer without
     setting the FPU control word explicitly.

     Setting the rounding of floating-point operations to less than the
     default 80 bits can speed some programs by 2% or more.  Note that
     some mathematical libraries assume that extended precision (80
     bit) floating-point operations are enabled by default; routines in
     such libraries could suffer significant loss of accuracy,
     typically through so-called "catastrophic cancellation", when this
     option is used to set the precision to less than extended
     precision.

`-mstackrealign'
     Realign the stack at entry.  On the Intel x86, the `-mstackrealign'
     option will generate an alternate prologue and epilogue that
     realigns the runtime stack if necessary.  This supports mixing
     legacy codes that keep a 4-byte aligned stack with modern codes
     that keep a 16-byte stack for SSE compatibility.  See also the
     attribute `force_align_arg_pointer', applicable to individual
     functions.

`-mpreferred-stack-boundary=NUM'
     Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to NUM
     byte boundary.  If `-mpreferred-stack-boundary' is not specified,
     the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).

`-mincoming-stack-boundary=NUM'
     Assume the incoming stack is aligned to a 2 raised to NUM byte
     boundary.  If `-mincoming-stack-boundary' is not specified, the
     one specified by `-mpreferred-stack-boundary' will be used.

     On Pentium and PentiumPro, `double' and `long double' values
     should be aligned to an 8 byte boundary (see `-malign-double') or
     suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium
     III, the Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) data type `__m128' may not
     work properly if it is not 16 byte aligned.

     To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack
     boundary must be as aligned as that required by any value stored
     on the stack.  Further, every function must be generated such that
     it keeps the stack aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with
     a higher preferred stack boundary from a function compiled with a
     lower preferred stack boundary will most likely misalign the
     stack.  It is recommended that libraries that use callbacks always
     use the default setting.

     This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
     increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage,
     such as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to
     reduce the preferred alignment to `-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2'.

`-mmmx'
`-mno-mmx'
`-msse'
`-mno-sse'
`-msse2'
`-mno-sse2'
`-msse3'
`-mno-sse3'
`-mssse3'
`-mno-ssse3'
`-msse4.1'
`-mno-sse4.1'
`-msse4.2'
`-mno-sse4.2'
`-msse4'
`-mno-sse4'
`-mavx'
`-mno-avx'
`-maes'
`-mno-aes'
`-mpclmul'
`-mno-pclmul'
`-msse4a'
`-mno-sse4a'
`-mfma4'
`-mno-fma4'
`-mxop'
`-mno-xop'
`-mlwp'
`-mno-lwp'
`-m3dnow'
`-mno-3dnow'
`-mpopcnt'
`-mno-popcnt'
`-mabm'
`-mno-abm'
     These switches enable or disable the use of instructions in the
     MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, AVX, AES, PCLMUL, SSE4A,
     FMA4, XOP, LWP, ABM or 3DNow! extended instruction sets.  These
     extensions are also available as built-in functions: see *note X86
     Built-in Functions::, for details of the functions enabled and
     disabled by these switches.

     To have SSE/SSE2 instructions generated automatically from
     floating-point code (as opposed to 387 instructions), see
     `-mfpmath=sse'.

     GCC depresses SSEx instructions when `-mavx' is used. Instead, it
     generates new AVX instructions or AVX equivalence for all SSEx
     instructions when needed.

     These options will enable GCC to use these extended instructions in
     generated code, even without `-mfpmath=sse'.  Applications which
     perform runtime CPU detection must compile separate files for each
     supported architecture, using the appropriate flags.  In
     particular, the file containing the CPU detection code should be
     compiled without these options.

`-mfused-madd'
`-mno-fused-madd'
     Do (don't) generate code that uses the fused multiply/add or
     multiply/subtract instructions.  The default is to use these
     instructions.

`-mcld'
     This option instructs GCC to emit a `cld' instruction in the
     prologue of functions that use string instructions.  String
     instructions depend on the DF flag to select between autoincrement
     or autodecrement mode.  While the ABI specifies the DF flag to be
     cleared on function entry, some operating systems violate this
     specification by not clearing the DF flag in their exception
     dispatchers.  The exception handler can be invoked with the DF flag
     set which leads to wrong direction mode, when string instructions
     are used.  This option can be enabled by default on 32-bit x86
     targets by configuring GCC with the `--enable-cld' configure
     option.  Generation of `cld' instructions can be suppressed with
     the `-mno-cld' compiler option in this case.

`-mcx16'
     This option will enable GCC to use CMPXCHG16B instruction in
     generated code.  CMPXCHG16B allows for atomic operations on
     128-bit double quadword (or oword) data types.  This is useful for
     high resolution counters that could be updated by multiple
     processors (or cores).  This instruction is generated as part of
     atomic built-in functions: see *note Atomic Builtins:: for details.

`-msahf'
     This option will enable GCC to use SAHF instruction in generated
     64-bit code.  Early Intel CPUs with Intel 64 lacked LAHF and SAHF
     instructions supported by AMD64 until introduction of Pentium 4 G1
     step in December 2005.  LAHF and SAHF are load and store
     instructions, respectively, for certain status flags.  In 64-bit
     mode, SAHF instruction is used to optimize `fmod', `drem' or
     `remainder' built-in functions: see *note Other Builtins:: for
     details.

`-mmovbe'
     This option will enable GCC to use movbe instruction to implement
     `__builtin_bswap32' and `__builtin_bswap64'.

`-mcrc32'
     This option will enable built-in functions,
     `__builtin_ia32_crc32qi', `__builtin_ia32_crc32hi'.
     `__builtin_ia32_crc32si' and `__builtin_ia32_crc32di' to generate
     the crc32 machine instruction.

`-mrecip'
     This option will enable GCC to use RCPSS and RSQRTSS instructions
     (and their vectorized variants RCPPS and RSQRTPS) with an
     additional Newton-Raphson step to increase precision instead of
     DIVSS and SQRTSS (and their vectorized variants) for single
     precision floating point arguments.  These instructions are
     generated only when `-funsafe-math-optimizations' is enabled
     together with `-finite-math-only' and `-fno-trapping-math'.  Note
     that while the throughput of the sequence is higher than the
     throughput of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the
     sequence can be decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0
     equals 0.99999994).

     Note that GCC implements 1.0f/sqrtf(x) in terms of RSQRTSS (or
     RSQRTPS) already with `-ffast-math' (or the above option
     combination), and doesn't need `-mrecip'.

`-mveclibabi=TYPE'
     Specifies the ABI type to use for vectorizing intrinsics using an
     external library.  Supported types are `svml' for the Intel short
     vector math library and `acml' for the AMD math core library style
     of interfacing.  GCC will currently emit calls to `vmldExp2',
     `vmldLn2', `vmldLog102', `vmldLog102', `vmldPow2', `vmldTanh2',
     `vmldTan2', `vmldAtan2', `vmldAtanh2', `vmldCbrt2', `vmldSinh2',
     `vmldSin2', `vmldAsinh2', `vmldAsin2', `vmldCosh2', `vmldCos2',
     `vmldAcosh2', `vmldAcos2', `vmlsExp4', `vmlsLn4', `vmlsLog104',
     `vmlsLog104', `vmlsPow4', `vmlsTanh4', `vmlsTan4', `vmlsAtan4',
     `vmlsAtanh4', `vmlsCbrt4', `vmlsSinh4', `vmlsSin4', `vmlsAsinh4',
     `vmlsAsin4', `vmlsCosh4', `vmlsCos4', `vmlsAcosh4' and `vmlsAcos4'
     for corresponding function type when `-mveclibabi=svml' is used
     and `__vrd2_sin', `__vrd2_cos', `__vrd2_exp', `__vrd2_log',
     `__vrd2_log2', `__vrd2_log10', `__vrs4_sinf', `__vrs4_cosf',
     `__vrs4_expf', `__vrs4_logf', `__vrs4_log2f', `__vrs4_log10f' and
     `__vrs4_powf' for corresponding function type when
     `-mveclibabi=acml' is used. Both `-ftree-vectorize' and
     `-funsafe-math-optimizations' have to be enabled. A SVML or ACML
     ABI compatible library will have to be specified at link time.

`-mabi=NAME'
     Generate code for the specified calling convention.  Permissible
     values are: `sysv' for the ABI used on GNU/Linux and other systems
     and `ms' for the Microsoft ABI.  The default is to use the
     Microsoft ABI when targeting Windows.  On all other systems, the
     default is the SYSV ABI.  You can control this behavior for a
     specific function by using the function attribute
     `ms_abi'/`sysv_abi'.  *Note Function Attributes::.

`-mpush-args'
`-mno-push-args'
     Use PUSH operations to store outgoing parameters.  This method is
     shorter and usually equally fast as method using SUB/MOV
     operations and is enabled by default.  In some cases disabling it
     may improve performance because of improved scheduling and reduced
     dependencies.

`-maccumulate-outgoing-args'
     If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing
     arguments will be computed in the function prologue.  This is
     faster on most modern CPUs because of reduced dependencies,
     improved scheduling and reduced stack usage when preferred stack
     boundary is not equal to 2.  The drawback is a notable increase in
     code size.  This switch implies `-mno-push-args'.

`-mthreads'
     Support thread-safe exception handling on `Mingw32'.  Code that
     relies on thread-safe exception handling must compile and link all
     code with the `-mthreads' option.  When compiling, `-mthreads'
     defines `-D_MT'; when linking, it links in a special thread helper
     library `-lmingwthrd' which cleans up per thread exception
     handling data.

`-mno-align-stringops'
     Do not align destination of inlined string operations.  This
     switch reduces code size and improves performance in case the
     destination is already aligned, but GCC doesn't know about it.

`-minline-all-stringops'
     By default GCC inlines string operations only when destination is
     known to be aligned at least to 4 byte boundary.  This enables
     more inlining, increase code size, but may improve performance of
     code that depends on fast memcpy, strlen and memset for short
     lengths.

`-minline-stringops-dynamically'
     For string operation of unknown size, inline runtime checks so for
     small blocks inline code is used, while for large blocks library
     call is used.

`-mstringop-strategy=ALG'
     Overwrite internal decision heuristic about particular algorithm
     to inline string operation with.  The allowed values are
     `rep_byte', `rep_4byte', `rep_8byte' for expanding using i386
     `rep' prefix of specified size, `byte_loop', `loop',
     `unrolled_loop' for expanding inline loop, `libcall' for always
     expanding library call.

`-momit-leaf-frame-pointer'
     Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.
     This avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore frame
     pointers and makes an extra register available in leaf functions.
     The option `-fomit-frame-pointer' removes the frame pointer for
     all functions which might make debugging harder.

`-mtls-direct-seg-refs'
`-mno-tls-direct-seg-refs'
     Controls whether TLS variables may be accessed with offsets from
     the TLS segment register (`%gs' for 32-bit, `%fs' for 64-bit), or
     whether the thread base pointer must be added.  Whether or not this
     is legal depends on the operating system, and whether it maps the
     segment to cover the entire TLS area.

     For systems that use GNU libc, the default is on.

`-msse2avx'
`-mno-sse2avx'
     Specify that the assembler should encode SSE instructions with VEX
     prefix.  The option `-mavx' turns this on by default.

 These `-m' switches are supported in addition to the above on AMD
x86-64 processors in 64-bit environments.

`-m32'
`-m64'
     Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit
     environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits and generates
     code that runs on any i386 system.  The 64-bit environment sets
     int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits and generates code
     for AMD's x86-64 architecture. For darwin only the -m64 option
     turns off the `-fno-pic' and `-mdynamic-no-pic' options.

`-mno-red-zone'
     Do not use a so called red zone for x86-64 code.  The red zone is
     mandated by the x86-64 ABI, it is a 128-byte area beyond the
     location of the stack pointer that will not be modified by signal
     or interrupt handlers and therefore can be used for temporary data
     without adjusting the stack pointer.  The flag `-mno-red-zone'
     disables this red zone.

`-mcmodel=small'
     Generate code for the small code model: the program and its
     symbols must be linked in the lower 2 GB of the address space.
     Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can be statically or dynamically
     linked.  This is the default code model.

`-mcmodel=kernel'
     Generate code for the kernel code model.  The kernel runs in the
     negative 2 GB of the address space.  This model has to be used for
     Linux kernel code.

`-mcmodel=medium'
     Generate code for the medium model: The program is linked in the
     lower 2 GB of the address space.  Small symbols are also placed
     there.  Symbols with sizes larger than `-mlarge-data-threshold'
     are put into large data or bss sections and can be located above
     2GB.  Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.

`-mcmodel=large'
     Generate code for the large model: This model makes no assumptions
     about addresses and sizes of sections.

3.17.16 IA-64 Options
---------------------

These are the `-m' options defined for the Intel IA-64 architecture.

`-mbig-endian'
     Generate code for a big endian target.  This is the default for
     HP-UX.

`-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for a little endian target.  This is the default for
     AIX5 and GNU/Linux.

`-mgnu-as'
`-mno-gnu-as'
     Generate (or don't) code for the GNU assembler.  This is the
     default.

`-mgnu-ld'
`-mno-gnu-ld'
     Generate (or don't) code for the GNU linker.  This is the default.

`-mno-pic'
     Generate code that does not use a global pointer register.  The
     result is not position independent code, and violates the IA-64
     ABI.

`-mvolatile-asm-stop'
`-mno-volatile-asm-stop'
     Generate (or don't) a stop bit immediately before and after
     volatile asm statements.

`-mregister-names'
`-mno-register-names'
     Generate (or don't) `in', `loc', and `out' register names for the
     stacked registers.  This may make assembler output more readable.

`-mno-sdata'
`-msdata'
     Disable (or enable) optimizations that use the small data section.
     This may be useful for working around optimizer bugs.

`-mconstant-gp'
     Generate code that uses a single constant global pointer value.
     This is useful when compiling kernel code.

`-mauto-pic'
     Generate code that is self-relocatable.  This implies
     `-mconstant-gp'.  This is useful when compiling firmware code.

`-minline-float-divide-min-latency'
     Generate code for inline divides of floating point values using
     the minimum latency algorithm.

`-minline-float-divide-max-throughput'
     Generate code for inline divides of floating point values using
     the maximum throughput algorithm.

`-mno-inline-float-divide'
     Do not generate inline code for divides of floating point values.

`-minline-int-divide-min-latency'
     Generate code for inline divides of integer values using the
     minimum latency algorithm.

`-minline-int-divide-max-throughput'
     Generate code for inline divides of integer values using the
     maximum throughput algorithm.

`-mno-inline-int-divide'
     Do not generate inline code for divides of integer values.

`-minline-sqrt-min-latency'
     Generate code for inline square roots using the minimum latency
     algorithm.

`-minline-sqrt-max-throughput'
     Generate code for inline square roots using the maximum throughput
     algorithm.

`-mno-inline-sqrt'
     Do not generate inline code for sqrt.

`-mfused-madd'
`-mno-fused-madd'
     Do (don't) generate code that uses the fused multiply/add or
     multiply/subtract instructions.  The default is to use these
     instructions.

`-mno-dwarf2-asm'
`-mdwarf2-asm'
     Don't (or do) generate assembler code for the DWARF2 line number
     debugging info.  This may be useful when not using the GNU
     assembler.

`-mearly-stop-bits'
`-mno-early-stop-bits'
     Allow stop bits to be placed earlier than immediately preceding the
     instruction that triggered the stop bit.  This can improve
     instruction scheduling, but does not always do so.

`-mfixed-range=REGISTER-RANGE'
     Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
     A fixed register is one that the register allocator can not use.
     This is useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is
     specified as two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register
     ranges can be specified separated by a comma.

`-mtls-size=TLS-SIZE'
     Specify bit size of immediate TLS offsets.  Valid values are 14,
     22, and 64.

`-mtune=CPU-TYPE'
     Tune the instruction scheduling for a particular CPU, Valid values
     are itanium, itanium1, merced, itanium2, and mckinley.

`-milp32'
`-mlp64'
     Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit
     environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits.  The 64-bit
     environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.
     These are HP-UX specific flags.

`-mno-sched-br-data-spec'
`-msched-br-data-spec'
     (Dis/En)able data speculative scheduling before reload.  This will
     result in generation of the ld.a instructions and the
     corresponding check instructions (ld.c / chk.a).  The default is
     'disable'.

`-msched-ar-data-spec'
`-mno-sched-ar-data-spec'
     (En/Dis)able data speculative scheduling after reload.  This will
     result in generation of the ld.a instructions and the
     corresponding check instructions (ld.c / chk.a).  The default is
     'enable'.

`-mno-sched-control-spec'
`-msched-control-spec'
     (Dis/En)able control speculative scheduling.  This feature is
     available only during region scheduling (i.e. before reload).
     This will result in generation of the ld.s instructions and the
     corresponding check instructions chk.s .  The default is 'disable'.

`-msched-br-in-data-spec'
`-mno-sched-br-in-data-spec'
     (En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that are
     dependent on the data speculative loads before reload.  This is
     effective only with `-msched-br-data-spec' enabled.  The default
     is 'enable'.

`-msched-ar-in-data-spec'
`-mno-sched-ar-in-data-spec'
     (En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that are
     dependent on the data speculative loads after reload.  This is
     effective only with `-msched-ar-data-spec' enabled.  The default
     is 'enable'.

`-msched-in-control-spec'
`-mno-sched-in-control-spec'
     (En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that are
     dependent on the control speculative loads.  This is effective
     only with `-msched-control-spec' enabled.  The default is 'enable'.

`-mno-sched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns'
`-msched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns'
     If enabled, data speculative instructions will be chosen for
     schedule only if there are no other choices at the moment.  This
     will make the use of the data speculation much more conservative.
     The default is 'disable'.

`-mno-sched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns'
`-msched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns'
     If enabled, control speculative instructions will be chosen for
     schedule only if there are no other choices at the moment.  This
     will make the use of the control speculation much more
     conservative.  The default is 'disable'.

`-mno-sched-count-spec-in-critical-path'
`-msched-count-spec-in-critical-path'
     If enabled, speculative dependencies will be considered during
     computation of the instructions priorities.  This will make the
     use of the speculation a bit more conservative.  The default is
     'disable'.

`-msched-spec-ldc'
     Use a simple data speculation check.  This option is on by default.

`-msched-control-spec-ldc'
     Use a simple check for control speculation.  This option is on by
     default.

`-msched-stop-bits-after-every-cycle'
     Place a stop bit after every cycle when scheduling.  This option
     is on by default.

`-msched-fp-mem-deps-zero-cost'
     Assume that floating-point stores and loads are not likely to
     cause a conflict when placed into the same instruction group.
     This option is disabled by default.

`-msel-sched-dont-check-control-spec'
     Generate checks for control speculation in selective scheduling.
     This flag is disabled by default.

`-msched-max-memory-insns=MAX-INSNS'
     Limit on the number of memory insns per instruction group, giving
     lower priority to subsequent memory insns attempting to schedule
     in the same instruction group. Frequently useful to prevent cache
     bank conflicts.  The default value is 1.

`-msched-max-memory-insns-hard-limit'
     Disallow more than `msched-max-memory-insns' in instruction group.
     Otherwise, limit is `soft' meaning that we would prefer non-memory
     operations when limit is reached but may still schedule memory
     operations.

3.17.17 IA-64/VMS Options
-------------------------

These `-m' options are defined for the IA-64/VMS implementations:

`-mvms-return-codes'
     Return VMS condition codes from main. The default is to return
     POSIX style condition (e.g. error) codes.

`-mdebug-main=PREFIX'
     Flag the first routine whose name starts with PREFIX as the main
     routine for the debugger.

`-mmalloc64'
     Default to 64bit memory allocation routines.

3.17.18 LM32 Options
--------------------

These `-m' options are defined for the Lattice Mico32 architecture:

`-mbarrel-shift-enabled'
     Enable barrel-shift instructions.

`-mdivide-enabled'
     Enable divide and modulus instructions.

`-mmultiply-enabled'
     Enable multiply instructions.

`-msign-extend-enabled'
     Enable sign extend instructions.

`-muser-enabled'
     Enable user-defined instructions.

3.17.19 M32C Options
--------------------

`-mcpu=NAME'
     Select the CPU for which code is generated.  NAME may be one of
     `r8c' for the R8C/Tiny series, `m16c' for the M16C (up to /60)
     series, `m32cm' for the M16C/80 series, or `m32c' for the M32C/80
     series.

`-msim'
     Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This
     causes an alternate runtime library to be linked in which
     supports, for example, file I/O.  You must not use this option
     when generating programs that will run on real hardware; you must
     provide your own runtime library for whatever I/O functions are
     needed.

`-memregs=NUMBER'
     Specifies the number of memory-based pseudo-registers GCC will use
     during code generation.  These pseudo-registers will be used like
     real registers, so there is a tradeoff between GCC's ability to
     fit the code into available registers, and the performance penalty
     of using memory instead of registers.  Note that all modules in a
     program must be compiled with the same value for this option.
     Because of that, you must not use this option with the default
     runtime libraries gcc builds.

3.17.20 M32R/D Options
----------------------

These `-m' options are defined for Renesas M32R/D architectures:

`-m32r2'
     Generate code for the M32R/2.

`-m32rx'
     Generate code for the M32R/X.

`-m32r'
     Generate code for the M32R.  This is the default.

`-mmodel=small'
     Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
     addresses can be loaded with the `ld24' instruction), and assume
     all subroutines are reachable with the `bl' instruction.  This is
     the default.

     The addressability of a particular object can be set with the
     `model' attribute.

`-mmodel=medium'
     Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the
     compiler will generate `seth/add3' instructions to load their
     addresses), and assume all subroutines are reachable with the `bl'
     instruction.

`-mmodel=large'
     Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the
     compiler will generate `seth/add3' instructions to load their
     addresses), and assume subroutines may not be reachable with the
     `bl' instruction (the compiler will generate the much slower
